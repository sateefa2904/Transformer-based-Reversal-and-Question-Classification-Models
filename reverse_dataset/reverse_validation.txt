Something has happened to my car.
What's Tom doing right now?
Hope to see you again next year.
I want them to be my friends.
Ask her when he will come back.
The problem is that we have no money.
I've been looking for you all day.
Would you like me to help?
Mary has her back to us.
Let me know what you want to do.
Tom will always remember you.
What did you do at school today?
Tom got in his car.
Do I have to do it over again?
Why didn't Tom say anything?
You never tell me anything.
Did you see him go out?
I need to know more about Tom.
It was my first job.
I do not understand her.
I don't feel like going out this morning.
I have some friends to help.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning.
I remember everything you tell me.
I want to leave Boston.
How much time do I have?
I think he is right.
We're going to have to do this again.
He has never been late for school.
If you can, come with us.
How come you didn't tell Tom about me?
Tom doesn't know when Mary will be here.
I'm not going to ask Tom for anything.
Am I the only one?
That never happened to me.
This is the book I've been looking for.
Please give me a little more time.
Should I make something up?
I have to go to work.
I can't let you in there.
Mary has just come home.
I think we do a really good job.
I have nothing to do with him.
I'd like to see it.
Did he go home yesterday?
May I ask how old you are?
I've got something for you.
Tom didn't get to school in time.
When was the last time you saw him?
What time is it in Boston?
Why is Tom not here?
What do you think she said?
I want you to call Tom.
She is not up yet.
Tom did everything he could.
We want to talk with Tom.
I know what it's about.
I can't talk to Tom about anything.
What was it that you did there?
I want to know what's out there.
Tom asked me for help.
Is that all Tom told you?
Is that why you won't help Tom?
What time do you want me to come?
He was a good friend.
It won't take much time.
I've had a busy week.
Take all the time you need.
Tom is the one who did this.
Is there something we can do?
It's too late for you.
You live here alone, don't you?
She did not say anything.
Tom wants me to go with him.
That's all I live for.
I bought a new car.
Tom has to do something about this problem.
I know Tom from work.
Tom wants Mary to want him.
I like it when you do that.
Did you have a good time?
You should stay in bed.
I didn't believe him at first.
What is going on here?
I have no time to read.
Why not go to Boston?
You're the only one who can do this.
You do not have to come here.
You should not go alone.
Tom went with Mary to Boston.
You need not go there.
I thought Tom was with you.
I want to go there again.
Tom had nothing to read.
I thought you were in your room.
Can I have the money now?
Tom doesn't understand how that could have happened.
I used to love Boston.
Who said that to you?
I didn't know we had one.
I can't believe I'm really here.
You want me to come in?
I asked him where he was going.
How many friends do you have?
I'd like to stay for one night.
No one knew who he was.
They want to be with you.
I couldn't leave you alone.
Tom and Mary used to be friends.
Will you go with us?
I'm going to need your help.
She had no way to know about it.
Tom wants to make Mary happy.
Tell her that I love her.
I'd never say something like that.
We never talk about it.
What are you doing now?
I'll give you everything you need.
Are you going to eat that?
Would you like to see it?
I've got something for you.
I have a little something for you.
I didn't know you had children.
Tom is still in bed.
I thought you didn't know Tom.
Tom didn't know where the money came from.
I didn't know what to do first.
You're not the only one.
Don't give it to Tom.
I don't want to see it.
They did not know what to do first.
Tom knows what I did.
I just don't want to go with Tom.
Do I have to go right now?
Can you help me get out of here?
I want a little brother.
I like the way you look.
It was the only way to go.
Do you know what she said?
Why don't we get out of here?
I'm doing what I have to do.
I have something to tell you.
Where did Tom call from?
Don't you know his name?
We still have a little money left.
We know what you did.
Can I take it home?
No one knows what happened.
I don't understand why Tom doesn't like me.
Did you really like it?
Tom doesn't make much money.
Tom is looking at us.
When did your father come home?
I want to know how Tom is doing.
Does Tom like his job?
I don't know. What do you think?
Tom and I are old friends.
Do you like it or not?
Tom went back to work.
I want to get married and have children.
Tom was on the way.
Do what you have to do.
I need to say something.
I want to help out.
They told me to stay in the car.
You had a long day.
Tom wants to think it over.
What was Tom's last name?
Do you know who made it?
I'd really like to help.
Tell me what you saw.
Are you happy now, Tom?
I know what you were doing.
Look, I don't want you to say anything.
I speak French a little.
This is what I wanted.
He doesn't know what to do.
I want to read it.
You go to school, don't you?
I can't believe Tom didn't come.
When did you see her?
It was her that told me.
He is often late for school.
I'll come up with something.
I only know him by name.
She doesn't live here any more.
That's how I came to know her.
You have to speak English.
What did Tom want to eat?
Tom came here last week.
"You talk too much," he said.
This book is very good.
Tom saw that Mary was busy.
Do as I told you.
I was just going to work.
Do you still need my help?
I've been a little busy.
No one will believe him.
I don't have time for you.
I asked him what his name was.
I'd like to do more.
I have to get home.
I know what that is.
I'll give you this money.
I didn't need to tell him.
I see what you did there.
She didn't come after all.
Look, I'm a little busy.
He didn't believe it at first.
There's only one way to find out.
I want to talk to you about Tom.
Now don't you feel better?
Do you know where you want to go?
Tom asked me if I was happy.
Are you going to do it over again?
Tell us what you want to do.
I don't ever want to see you again.
Would you like me to help you?
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had to leave.
How do you come to school?
Tomorrow is the last day of school!
Tom can't speak French, can he?
How do you get to school?
What does Tom do every day?
"Who is it?" "It's your mother."
Please give me one of these.
He did what I told him to do.
We want to help you.
Are you in love with Tom?
Do you know anything about Tom?
I want to be with you.
I will tell you about him.
If you have something to say, say it.
I want to know where Tom is.
I just made a friend.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
May I ask you something?
Let's get out of the car now.
So what do we do now?
Tom doesn't love Mary like he used to.
He told me where to go.
There are a lot of people here.
You know I have to go.
I go where I please.
Do you know what you need?
Good to see you, Tom.
Why should I believe you?
Do you think you can do that, Tom?
I have nothing to do with it.
I got what I asked for.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I don't have any money at all.
May I speak to you?
I didn't know that he could speak English.
We have a little water.
I hope Tom is happy.
This is what we need.
Does Mary really love me?
You won't be in time for school.
I can't believe he did that.
I have just what you need.
I can't really do anything.
Tom did a good job.
It's more than just that.
I don't think he is right.
My friends call me Tom.
I don't know what you want from me.
Some of them are my friends.
He used to love her.
Do you want me to call Tom?
Come into the room after me.
What did you do there?
Tom made Mary do it.
I'll give it some thought.
Where are you going to live?
Tom wanted to stay at home.
Tom never did that here.
I don't get out much.
The two of them are in the room.
Let me ask you something.
He didn't do any work.
Some people don't think so.
They may not know about it.
I'm going to go with Tom.
I don't think he can do that.
You don't need to do that.
How many people are in this room?
I'm so happy to see you again.
I thought Tom would want to help me.
What have you told them?
Will you all be here tomorrow?
I just want to see Tom.
Tom, I need to talk to you.
I think we should do some more.
I can't remember where I bought it.
My friend wants to talk to you.
I went over to where Tom was.
Do you speak French well?
He wants me to help him.
What would you like to do?
You know what Tom wants.
Are you looking for something?
I don't want to see him again.
How old do you think I am?
Why are you so busy?
I did what I was told.
I want to be with Tom.
I'm sure I can help.
She knows who we are.
Do you want to eat something?
I thought that you could speak French.
You have to leave Boston.
I asked Tom to leave.
Is there anything I must do?
You remember that, don't you?
I wanted to speak with you about this.
I must speak with Tom.
I have been here for two years.
What is it you want to ask me?
Are you looking for a job?
I'll tell you about my father.
Do you come here often?
I really should be going.
For here, or to go?
I was at home all day yesterday.
Tom really does talk a lot.
I said I'd talk to Tom about it.
Can I talk to Tom?
He did not speak at all.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
Come on any day you like.
Does he know that you love him?
Find out what Tom wants.
When will he go home?
I have no money with me now.
I know what I need.
Will you come and see me?
I thought you went home.
Let's find out what's going on first.
All my friends speak French.
He had been there before.
I think you did very well.
She was left alone in the room.
She bought a new house the other day.
What can I do for you?
I'll see if he is in.
May I ask you something?
What do we do next?
We didn't know what to do.
Who told you to come here?
We don't let people like you in here.
Do you know when Tom will be home?
Could you please come over here?
Will you make room for me?
I'm going to tell you what I think.
I don't believe you just said that.
He was looking for a good job.
What did you say yesterday?
I want to get married.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
Could you do that for me?
We have to go on.
I don't really like you.
I want to talk with Tom.
I don't want to know anything about Tom.
I wish you had been there.
May I ask where you work?
I used to live there.
Tom wanted to stay at home.
You have to go back.
That will please my father.
I want you to read this book.
They want to know what's going on.
I think about you all the time.
I can read you like a book.
I don't want to know.
I will do anything but that.
A lot of people need our help.
I said he could go.
What was it that you gave him?
I can't remember ever doing that.
That's what I told them.
You can do anything you want to.
I've never had that problem before.
I should have told you before.
You can't help now. It's too late.
This is where Tom wants to live.
I don't know what you want to do.
I've never been this happy before.
Where do you come from?
Tom has a lot to think about.
I have something good to tell you.
We look up to him.
There's no way we're going to do that.
He is at home today.
Tom doesn't want to do this.
Is this what Tom wanted?
I thought you said you had a dog.
Do you need this book?
I like you a lot.
He asked me if I could speak English.
Is there something you need?
A lot of people do it.
Please take Tom with you.
It's not a problem at all.
Why would Tom do that?
Tom said he didn't want anything to eat.
I do not go to school.
What does Tom want Mary to do?
This is the book I want to read.
Why did you say that?
I'm sure that he's happy.
Give it to me now.
I told him to come.
Tom told Mary what to do.
I am looking for my friends.
Can I have it back now?
Did you have a good time yesterday?
We have always been friends.
Who do you live with?
Tom is in need of help.
How are we going to get there?
You don't speak French, do you?
I want you to use it.
I wish I could go back in time.
I want to talk with Tom alone.
I don't know when he will come.
He is married with two children.
Did Tom talk to you?
You don't know anything about me.
I have to stay home.
It isn't something I want to do.
Tom asked Mary how much money she had.
I'd like to read it.
What time did you get in?
All I want is to be left alone.
Tom went out to eat.
If you want to, we'll go.
I'll leave that to you.
We do not know him.
Tom doesn't have to do that now.
I'm too old for this.
Tom is happy when he is with Mary.
She said that she was ill.
Please just leave me alone.
What is the man doing?
Please come into the room.
I saw him looking at me.
I thought that was your job.
Who are the people I saw her with?
Why is Tom still in Boston?
She got married last year.
He can speak French and English.
I think you should do it.
When did Tom come back?
Please come to my house.
Let Tom know where I am.
I do remember the day very well.
Get out of the car.
Tom is not very happy.
Tom is on his way.
They, too, were out of money.
I have bought a car.
I know what they want me to do.
I may have to help Tom.
I'll do that right now.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom won't let you down.
I want to give you something.
I would do anything for you.
Go back to your bed.
How do you know this?
As for me, I like this better.
I know where you live.
He does not live there any more.
I wish I knew her name.
Does Tom know my name?
You like him, don't you?
I need to know everything that happened.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will be here.
Does it have to be today?
How could this have happened?
I would do anything for you.
Please tell me your name.
Tom isn't as busy as Mary is.
I just made it up.
He has just bought a used car.
Why didn't you just come to me?
Tom doesn't need any money now.
I don't know anything about him at all.
Tom knows we believe in him.
Please do this for me.
He doesn't know what's going on.
Is Tom on his way?
I bought it from Tom.
He didn't want to leave.
I'll do what I can to help you.
Let's go talk in the other room.
Are you sure you don't want it?
You didn't have to do that.
Do you come here often?
You remember me, don't you?
Tom couldn't understand why Mary didn't like him.
How did it go last night?
Do you know what he did?
Call it what you will.
I believe that he's happy.
Can you tell me what happened here?
I really need to see Tom.
Who does she think that she is?
I'm on my way out.
Do I need to do that now?
I know what you did.
They made us work all day long.
Why did you do it?
I wanted to help you.
They like to be alone.
Let's go out to eat.
I'm still looking for a job.
I can't read French, let alone speak it.
We won't let you down.
Tom doesn't understand French very well.
Tom doesn't have a car.
I thought Tom would leave with Mary.
We need a little more time.
What do you want to do today?
They want to help us.
I don't ever want to see you again.
What do you want to do first?
Tom knows just where to go.
I just got back from school.
I know you're busy, Tom.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
I want to stay with you.
I look up to you.
I'd like to know why you did it.
I know all about Tom.
Tom doesn't know anything about it.
I know how to do it.
Can I ask you something?
Tom doesn't have a house to live in.
Where have you been this week?
I don't want to do it again.
Don't read too much into this.
I was looking for you.
Life doesn't get any better.
Do you have any children?
Tom just wants something to eat.
Why do you think so?
I want you out of here right now.
Tom just does what he's told to do.
I wanted to ask you about something.
Tom asked me why I couldn't go.
I feel that I should help you.
He knows how to speak to children.
That doesn't work at all.
I'm happy to see you here.
I have to find Tom.
Get Tom out of here.
You could let us go.
You know we love you.
I have got to go now.
You have no right to do this.
You can't just leave me here.
Tom doesn't know what Mary has to do.
You know why I'm here, don't you?
Tom doesn't often come here.
I do not have much time.
What does Tom want from us?
My mother does not speak English.
I think he is right.
I believe you like your job.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants to do.
Tom didn't say anything at all.
I can't help you with this.
I don't have any children yet.
I see Tom here all the time.
I want to talk to all of them.
How many children are there?
I don't know what we will do.
You have to leave Boston.
We really need a man like you here.
Did you do your work?
Tom is in the other room.
I have to get to Tom.
I want to speak with Tom now.
My friends don't know where I am.
If you have nothing to say, say nothing.
Do you want to see?
And why would I do that?
I think he doesn't like it here.
I know I can do better.
How well do you know Tom?
I told her that she was right.
I didn't do that right.
He never said it again.
I will be here tomorrow.
I take back what I said.
I love you just as you are.
I have everything I need.
No one man could do it.
I don't want to eat anything.
Tom wants to be married to Mary.
I bought a new car.
I believe you like your job.
I only know that Tom isn't happy.
She used to live with him.
Tom wants to go with you.
Do we really need to leave now?
What did you talk about?
I said I would help you.
This is all that I know about him.
I do not have any money.
Tell her to help him.
You can see it now.
What did she do today?
I thought you didn't want to come.
What more do you need?
Are you busy tomorrow night?
What about the other one?
I wish we had a car.
You may be right about that.
What do you want to do with it?
They do not know how to do it.
Why don't you and Tom stay with us?
Why did you buy it?
Isn't that what you want?
You talk about Tom too much.
At last, we were home!
What time will you be back?
He's not sure he wants to do this.
I don't feel very happy.
He will not come today.
I knew Tom would ask that.
Do I need to be here tomorrow?
When should we tell Tom?
I know what I want to do.
I don't have anything to do right now.
I have no one to help me.
I really need to go.
I thought the play went very well.
He has a lot of money.
I won't see her again.
I've got too much to do.
I didn't think about what I was doing.
What do you want me to do?
I thought I'd always be alone.
Tom doesn't want to see anything today.
You should be in bed.
You must not go out today.
Tom didn't do anything to help Mary.
I really do want Tom to be happy.
She has never seen him.
I need to know who Tom is.
I'd do anything for you.
Tom didn't tell us everything.
There's something I need to do.
I want to talk to you, Tom.
I think I see the problem.
There's something I've got to do.
They won't tell us anything.
That's what you all say.
I'll give you a call.
He gave it to me for nothing.
Tom has been busy all morning.
You're going to love this book.
Do we really need it?
How did you get to know Mary?
Could you say that again?
I think we should buy a new house.
I'm going to work in Boston next year.
Don't you have something to do?
I know the man you came with.
What do you want this for?
Tom isn't at home now.
I'm not going to see you again.
There was no one left but me.
You're the only one who bought it.
I do not go to school.
I didn't buy the book.
I bought an old car.
I'm an old friend of Tom's father.
You know who he is.
Who told you to say that to me?
You need to help me.
It's something I have to do.
I think his name is Tom.
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
I could make her talk.
I bought a dog for him.
I hope to see them.
My English is not good at all.
I think your work is very good.
Does Tom work for Mary?
I know nothing about her.
Let's talk about your job.
Do you speak French every day?
I am not busy now.
I told Tom about it.
Can I speak to Tom?
We must have something to live for.
What did I do that for?
I know where you live.
I'm going to need some help.
You really don't want to do this.
Do you remember what I told you?
Did you get me anything?
I really have to get going.
This was his first job.
I can see why you like Tom.
What was he up to?
That's really what you want?
Where are you going now?
How long are you going for?
How could this have happened?
I don't want Tom to see this.
Tom isn't here now, but Mary is.
Do you take work home with you?
Tom should get a job.
He will always be there.
We need to find out what it is.
I don't know. What do you think?
Tom has a little money.
We don't know why he had to leave.
How many do you want?
Does he need to go right now?
I'm not really sure why.
How long does it take?
Something is still not right.
What are you doing now?
I got what I wanted.
I know you can make it.
All the people who were here have left.
May I call you back?
I won't put up with that.
You may call me Tom.
What did Tom do with the money?
Who told you to tell Tom to come?
Are you sure you want that one?
May I have a talk with you?
I'd like to see you.
Why did you do it?
Tell me everything about it.
You remember what happened last time, don't you?
This is where we live.
He doesn't know what to do.
You do not have to do it now.
We have to do something about this.
I have heard nothing from him yet.
Why do I have to do that?
I should read the book.
I'm not good at this.
Where will you be this time tomorrow?
Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't here.
I read your letter yesterday.
You need to talk to me.
Is there something you want to tell me?
There is no need for him to work.
We know what we want.
I can't believe he did this to me.
I can't stay for long.
It has Tom's name on it.
I bought this book yesterday.
How long have you been looking for it?
The more you have, the more you want.
When would you like to see him?
Tom and Mary did what they were told.
I want you to stay with me.
I think I remember doing that.
I can't tell you what I think.
I will go to school.
You must do as I tell you.
You should be happy for Tom.
Don't you have anything better to do?
I thought you and Tom were friends.
May I have one of these?
Why did Tom leave you?
I just want to go home.
Let's talk man to man.
It won't be long before they get married.
Tom took Mary back home.
I've got to find Tom.
Tom couldn't get Mary to do it.
She was ill for a long time.
He gave her a book.
Tom may not want to do that.
Why are you doing this?
I had to leave Boston.
Tom doesn't have a car.
I know you're a friend of Tom's.
I want my job back.
What did you say yesterday?
I love you more than I love her.
I'll call you up tomorrow.
Do you know how to get there?
Tom doesn't like to be alone.
Did you see what I did?
I don't remember where I bought it.
Tom just wanted to be left alone.
You must always do what is right.
I will give it to you.
Do you want to go back to Boston?
Can I ask why not?
Don't believe everything people tell you.
You saw Tom, didn't you?
What are you doing on your night off?
I got some help from a friend.
You're too old for me.
When did you get up?
You really did a good job.
I like it in Boston.
Tom was in love with Mary.
Don't take it out on me.
I wanted to be there.
Tom couldn't get the book he wanted.
How do you go to school?
Why does Tom want us to do this?
I must be going now.
You can't always do what you want.
You will stay at home.
I'd like to know why.
You won't get there on time.
I would like to see it.
A man came to see him.
Tom asked Mary to help.
I never asked for this.
Tom asked Mary to think it over.
He gave her a book.
I need you in Boston.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
She knows your mother very well.
Please put this into English.
I want to speak in French.
Tom didn't have any children.
They don't want you to know.
I would do anything for you.
Tom doesn't know what he should do.
There's nothing more I can tell you.
I can't go in there.
He used to read a lot.
Tell her that I know who she is.
Tom came to my house yesterday morning.
He asked me what I had bought.
I asked how Tom was.
I need a little help.
I can tell you what I know.
We're on our way home.
No one wanted to eat.
Tom did all he could.
I knew Tom was here.
Who do you want to speak to?
I want to talk to Tom now.
There's something I should tell you.
That book is very old.
I want you to work for me.
Let me know what you want to do.
Don't be late for school.
I'm sure Tom is looking out for Mary.
Why did you want to speak to me?
Give me a little more time.
What did you say to Tom?
I have to go to Boston.
She wants to go out with him.
It's time for you to go to bed.
I gave you a book.
Tom asked me what I had bought.
Look at me when I talk to you!
I like your friend very much.
I won't need any help.
Are you going to help us?
He did it right away.
I wanted to have children.
He is often late for school.
Do you talk to your dog?
I can't think of his name.
Are you back home now?
I told Tom what happened.
Why does no one believe me?
We all knew about it.
Do you know where he went?
That's why I want to talk to Tom.
There's just one day left.
Do you have a car?
Well, I have to go now.
Where does this book go?
I thought that was my job.
Please take Tom with you.
Tom should have been here by now.
It was all for nothing.
I want to be alone!
I'd like to see Tom one more time.
Tom is about to leave.
I eat here all the time.
You don't talk much, do you?
I bought her a new car.
Do you know where he went?
Why did you stay at home yesterday?
Tom knows nothing about Boston.
Tom was up all night.
That's not why I did it.
I need you to go home.
I have to use English all day.
I just want to go back to bed.
How did you know where to find us?
Tom is a lot better today.
I can't see anything from here.
She made friends with him in Boston.
Did you get my letter?
How many people are here today?
She gave him the car.
Are you looking for something?
He asked us to help him.
My father must do the work.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
I will not see him any more.
Why do I have to do this?
"I'll be back," said Tom.
Tom doesn't have to do that.
Doesn't that make you happy?
This is what I have been looking for.
I know who you want to talk to.
My friends are all married.
I did everything I was told to do.
He used to live here.
I've got everything I want.
That isn't much, is it?
He does nothing but play all day.
I want you so much.
He gave me back the money.
I did it for you.
Tom gave it to Mary.
Where did he do it?
Tom couldn't believe what Mary said.
Tom knew nothing about it.
There's nothing more to be said.
I can't think of his name.
You know me so well.
I wish you had come with us.
What do you want from me?
I know what's going on.
Tom doesn't know what to say.
English is used by many people.
She wants him to be her friend.
I want to think about it.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Isn't there something we can do?
Find out more about Tom.
What time did your friend go home?
Tom doesn't like to talk about his work.
Tom has something to do right now.
My father gave me a lot of money.
He told her that she was right.
When did Tom get back?
Give me a little money.
Did you get Tom something?
We have been married for three years.
Have you heard from him?
I don't need anything from you.
I should not have said that.
He came home very late.
Do you want to stay here all day?
This is not my car.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Can I have some of these?
You must do it this way.
This is for my friend.
We have a lot of time.
Do you want to say something?
I don't want you to say anything.
I hope you know what this is.
I have no one to play with.
This is the last time.
I'll leave it up to you.
I must talk to you.
I know that you know that I know.
How often do you see her?
I can't believe you remember that.
I don't know if I'll have time.
There was nothing left over.
There is a letter for you.
I don't know what that is.
Ask him what to do next.
I was with Tom all day.
That's not how I feel.
I come here every day.
How do you want them?
I can't remember what his name is.
Are you happy with that?
Where are you right now?
I think you should do it.
Tom doesn't want to go out.
Tom isn't the only one.
Don't you want to know why?
Tell it to him, not me!
I want to talk to you about Tom.
Don't you have something to do?
That's going to make Tom very happy.
How do you feel today?
Let's see if we can help you.
I don't want you to see this.
I didn't know where it came from.
I do not have any money.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come.
If you need me, call.
Do you still want to talk to me?
Tom won't ask for help.
This is how it has always been.
Don't speak to him like that.
Tom couldn't think of anything to say.
They don't understand me when I speak French.
Tell me something about Tom.
I see you remember me.
Get in the car now.
Do you need more money?
Why are you doing this to me?
What time do you go home?
I really want to go home now.
May I put it down here?
I am going to see him today.
Let's talk about the problem.
I hope that you are very well.
I can't think of life without you.
That's what I'm looking for.
I'll never leave you alone again.
Let me come with you.
Why did you leave Tom alone?
I'll give that to Tom.
Where have you been all this time?
Let's not stay here long.
It's time to go to bed.
I think of you all the time.
I'm not who you think I am.
Tom is in the house.
Tom is a happy man.
You have to leave Boston.
You two come with me.
I need to get out of here.
Tom bought something for Mary.
I can't remember doing that.
I thought Tom would want the work.
Tell me what Tom said.
What do you want to give Tom?
Tom and I are good friends.
Tom doesn't want to talk to Mary.
I wish he were here.
How long do I have to stay?
Who do you live with?
I'm sure that he's happy.
I'm so happy you're here.
Tom got in his car.
He didn't give me anything to eat.
Do you know any of Tom's friends?
I went to Boston last year.
I'm going to go get Tom now.
He had nothing to say, so he left.
There's something I should tell you.
Let me tell you something.
Tom told Mary not to be late again.
Tell me who you saw.
I know why Tom is busy.
Tell them to come here.
Tom doesn't like my friends.
I can see you're good at this.
I want to go with you, Tom.
Tom asked me to tell you something.
She is at work right now.
Please tell us what happened.
I went to school yesterday.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.
Get out of the water.
Tom and Mary are very good friends.
I have been busy today.
She told me she knew my brother.
I told Tom not to come here.
Tom won't have that problem.
Put it where you like.
Tom told Mary what had happened.
Does Tom know what you're doing?
I'm sure that Tom will do that.
You were late for work.
I can speak a little French.
Are you going to buy the car?
Where do you want to eat?
It's time for you to get up.
I wanted to see you.
Tom didn't come home from school yesterday.
I don't know why you don't like him.
I'd like to get to know you better.
That's all I can do for now.
I never make my bed.
I'm not sure I want the job.
I never said that to you.
When will we go home?
No one had anything left to say.
Tom has nothing to do with this.
What did you say to me?
She and I get on well.
Why didn't you believe me?
I think Tom and Mary are in love.
I've been told your name.
Tell me what you have.
Tom asked me how to do it.
Tom asked Mary to help me.
I know that Tom knows.
I think this is going to work.
I need you to see this.
Tom wanted you to have this.
Tom doesn't know what happened to Mary.
Do you really want me to do that?
I think you need to eat more.
Tell me where you live.
You used to look up to your father.
I'll be back tomorrow night.
I'm here to ask for your help.
Does Tom need to stay home today?
I just need some time.
Tom is very busy with his work.
I've got everything that you want.
I don't know what you call this.
He asked for more money.
Who do you work for?
There was much work to do.
I didn't do what Tom said I did.
I don't want to think about that.
Do you have a house?
I don't want to live alone.
Tom is in love with you.
Tom didn't have anything to say to Mary.
Will you come back tomorrow?
Can you go with us?
Tom couldn't believe what Mary told him.
Tom doesn't want to get out of bed.
Please give me the letter.
Don't tell Tom about what we did today.
That was the last time I saw Tom.
Tom and Mary are now alone.
We know everything about you.
I'd like to know where Tom is.
I don't like you at all.
I couldn't have made it alone.
We want to talk with you.
I'd like to see her again.
The other one doesn't work.
Do you talk to your dog?
May I ask how old you are?
She is in love with him.
I told Tom not to come back.
It was the only way.
How did he come here?
You know Tom was right.
We don't like this house.
Tom should ask Mary how to do it.
We were looking for you.
I know you're in love with me.
I thought Tom was married.
Where did you eat last night?
I don't remember where I bought it.
I'd like to buy that one.
Will you come with us?
Why would Tom do something like that?
Have you been there before?
You can be anything you want.
May I eat a little of it?
Do you have a car?
If you can't come, we'll understand.
Tom could do with some help.
I want to go with Tom.
I hope he isn't ill.
What do you like to eat?
Take it, or leave it.
Put the book back where it was.
He's going to love this.
I don't feel up to it.
That's not going to help.
They don't like my friends.
I told him to leave the room.
This is always the way it has been.
That's what happened the last time.
I want to do everything Tom did.
I don't know if I still have it.
I thought we could talk.
I look up to you.
Tom wanted it this way.
I wanted you to know how I feel.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
You didn't come to school yesterday, did you?
I want to go back.
She went with him to Boston.
I still can't speak French.
Tell him not to be late for school.
I don't have much money.
I would do anything for you.
I didn't ask Tom to go there.
In a way, you are right.
I asked him if he knew my name.
How long are you going to stay?
Did you understand what he said?
Can we please go home now?
Tom had nothing to say.
I told Tom to go.
Who do you stay with?
Would you like me to help you?
That's what you don't understand.
I don't remember you at all.
I still don't see anything.
What is he up to now?
Why don't they like me?
I don't want to leave Boston.
Tom can't just do anything he wants.
I think about that from time to time.
I was just here yesterday.
Why won't they let Mary go?
Does Tom do it right?
