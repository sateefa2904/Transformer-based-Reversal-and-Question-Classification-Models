This is not what we want.
I asked him to go there tomorrow.
I have bought a car.
I think he will never come back.
I do not have any money.
Tom told me you were here.
I love this time of year.
I can't just do nothing.
They will never find us.
Can you do it alone?
I know you can help us.
I don't have any money.
They don't want you to know.
Tom is still in love with Mary.
I knew I was right.
She made a man of him.
You have to leave Boston.
My father has just come home.
She went out with her dog.
Tom made me eat it.
I wish he were here.
I read the book last night.
I didn't know she was married.
How did it go last night?
We just had a talk.
I could not speak to him.
Is Tom over there with you?
I do not go to school.
I want Tom left alone.
I don't know what happened.
He knows a lot of people.
He can speak English and French.
We know who did this.
I want the other one.
That's not what you said before.
Tom doesn't want me to stay.
It's not what we want.
That's the way Tom always does it.
Why do people have children?
I'm not sure where Tom is from.
Do you know what you should do?
Does Tom know anything about it?
Tom and Mary are in Tom's car.
We can't go home yet.
Tom left this for you.
What were you two doing?
What do you think she is doing now?
I thought Tom was here with you.
Read it one more time, please.
I say what I think.
Why are you so late?
How did you do it?
I want to talk to you, Tom.
Tom didn't do that right.
Tom doesn't want to give up.
Why are you looking at Mary?
What are you looking for?
That's the first time that's happened.
Tell me something I don't know.
This is a very old book.
I saw him looking at me.
Tom asked me about Mary.
Why did Tom do it?
Can we work on that now?
I only need to buy one.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I want you to work with me.
We want to see Tom.
I saw Tom last night.
I didn't know she was married.
I think I've been here before.
Why didn't you do that?
I'd like to see her.
What are you going to play?
I didn't know Tom was here.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
What are you good at?
Why don't you look for a job?
Why do you take so long to eat?
This is what he said.
There is something you must know.
Tom is an old friend.
Let me ask you something.
May I go with him?
Tom was at home alone.
Please don't make me ask Tom.
Does this have anything to do with Tom?
She bought him a dog.
How long are you going to stay there?
I'm sure we can work this out.
I just need to talk to you.
Do you want our help or don't you?
I want him to go there.
Can't you see I'm busy?
I used to work for Tom.
I think Tom knows something.
Who can speak French better, Tom or Mary?
I love you and I always will.
Do you really want to be here?
I can't believe you're doing this.
I'd like you to go there.
I know you better than you think.
What can we do to help you?
I am going to do it.
I want to see you before you go.
I'll be busy next week.
Do you want my help or not?
Let Tom know where I am.
Do you know all these people?
What don't you want us to see?
Tom didn't know where Mary wanted to live.
What did Tom do here?
This is all you have to do now.
I wanted to be alone.
I have more money than Tom.
I do remember doing that.
Are you going to go?
I don't speak French well.
Why do you like Boston so much?
Tom doesn't know anything yet.
I thought you wanted me to help you.
I took a week off.
I can't help doing that.
I don't know what we will do.
You know something about this, don't you?
Where would you like to go?
I knew Tom very well.
I think that he is right.
Is that what Tom would want?
You did not come to school yesterday.
What were they doing there?
Tom can speak French as well.
I just want you to be happy.
Tom got the job he wanted.
No one could buy anything.
Why did you do it?
When was the last time you saw Tom?
You're not the only one.
I didn't like what he said at all.
I think Tom is right.
I don't need Tom's help.
That's a lot of money.
May I speak in French?
I want to be more than friends.
I know you can make it better.
Get Tom away from me.
We'll never go back there again.
I live just over there.
I didn't say you were here.
You should go home now.
I must leave tomorrow morning.
I don't know who my mother is.
I don't need anything from you.
How long does Tom have?
You know why I left.
Please find out where she is.
He gave him a book.
Tom saw what Mary did.
There's something I should tell you.
Tom has to go back to Boston tomorrow.
I don't understand why you want it.
I need to see Tom right now.
This is all Tom has to do.
How could I help you?
What are you doing here?
We want to help Tom.
Were they busy last week?
Tom is still at school.
Let's call it a day.
I know who took Tom.
I want to eat out today.
If you need help, let me know.
Is that from a book?
Where do you want to go?
I need to read a lot.
I want you to read this letter.
I like Boston a lot.
What did Tom want to eat?
Tom has a friend in Boston.
Tom is never going to love you.
Don't you have any money?
Do you wish to do that now?
Do you need to do that again?
When did you ask Tom?
Please let me go home.
I want him to go there.
Do you really want to get married?
You have to go alone.
He gave me back the money.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
You have to go back.
I need to tell you something.
Tom did what I told him to do.
If you don't like it, don't eat it.
I think I have a problem.
Where do you live now?
He's too old for you.
We're on the way home.
I know what his name is.
Tom didn't buy anything for Mary.
Why are you always late for school?
Tom is not as old as you.
I said that I would help him.
I have to eat, too.
Don't you want to see Tom again?
"Who is it?" "It's me."
He read the letter over and over.
I need to know who you are.
Why don't you buy a car?
No one can help you.
Tell me what's going on.
Do you want to do it?
No one can help me.
Did you want to tell me something?
Tom heard that Mary got married.
You know where I work.
I think you need to see him.
Do you know who he was?
Do you know where I can get help?
They told you what happened, didn't they?
I'm not going to talk about that.
I just want to help Tom.
I don't want to be late for work.
Is it only about money?
I remember the first time.
It is time to go to bed.
Let me think this over.
I don't like that at all.
I go where I want to go.
You can go if you want to.
I didn't want to say anything.
I'm on my way home.
Do I really have to go to bed?
You understand me very well.
Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone.
Who asked you to do that?
You should leave it for tomorrow.
There's something I want to ask you.
She asked me about my mother.
We're not doing this for the money.
There's no way I'm doing that.
Tom doesn't know why it happened.
This is the book I told you about.
I know I'm in the way.
When do you want me back here?
Don't you ever do anything other than read?
I have nothing more to do today.
She can't understand other people.
I didn't know you knew Tom.
My father is in his room.
I had to tell Tom.
You may take the book.
I'm a little busy now.
I've got to go now.
Why don't you go find Tom?
Tom went back to his room.
I want to see my brother.
I'd better talk to Tom.
Do you want to look at this?
I wanted to love Tom.
I'm going to help Tom.
I don't go out much.
I want you to look for Tom.
I got a call from her this morning.
You didn't see what I saw.
Did you really love me?
I don't know what you think.
This is where he used to work.
Who was there that night?
I like this. I will take it.
I thought Tom did very well.
Everything is all right now.
I don't want to know.
How many more are there?
I don't want to go to work today.
He's too old for her.
Does he know what you did?
Do you want me to help you?
You want it, don't you?
I saw that he was right.
Tom doesn't know who to ask.
Why didn't you do it?
I read a book last night.
There's something I have to know.
She didn't know what to say to him.
I just want you to go away.
I want you to tell me about Tom.
That is why he was late for school.
You know I have to go.
Do it just like this.
He must be the one for me.
I don't want you here.
I didn't need to do that right away.
His mother didn't want to do it.
He doesn't know English at all.
How old are your children?
I only have one brother.
She doesn't speak to me.
I don't like this book.
I wish I had been there with you.
How much for the night?
Did you eat something last night?
How did you get there?
Can I ask you something?
I'll never see Tom ever again.
Everything is all right now.
Was Tom here when it happened?
I'm not sure what I should do.
What time did you get up this morning?
She doesn't like going to school.
Tom doesn't know who he should ask.
This is all the money I have.
He came to see me.
I don't need anything from you.
He will go as well.
Why don't you want to go?
Tom wants to stay here.
You have to stay here.
You need to talk to me.
I'll tell Tom you said that.
I know I've told you this before.
I need to find a job.
Tom doesn't speak to Mary.
It's not up to me.
She doesn't live there any more.
Where do you want to live?
We don't have much time.
Please let me know what you want.
He came into my room.
I like it very much.
I thought you were going to help.
They don't want Tom back.
You are in my way.
He doesn't want to go to school.
I thought you were Tom's friend.
May I talk to Tom?
Tom asked me what I wanted.
My father is at home.
I don't know what to believe.
He is just the man for the job.
Let's see what it is.
I saw my friends yesterday.
I didn't know that you knew Tom.
Would you like to eat?
I told Tom what I saw.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.
I thought he would come.
I would love to see it.
Don't talk to me that way.
Tom wants to be your friend.
Tom is very busy right now.
Why don't you leave, Tom?
This is not my home.
Tom was really into it.
I love him just as he is.
I want to know about Tom's new job.
We know where it is.
Tom doesn't want to go.
I'm not sure right now.
I bought the book yesterday.
I have to leave now.
When will you be back?
We know who you are.
Tom doesn't want anything to eat.
Please go and see who it is.
This is what you have to do.
I'd like to know more about Tom.
I'll be there to help you do that.
I will do anything for you.
Why didn't Tom go with you?
Do you want me to leave you alone?
That's how Tom does it.
I may be too old.
You asked me to help.
Why does Tom need that?
I never knew my father.
Tom is really good at his job.
I'm going to tell you something.
Do you know how to use it?
I think about him all the time.
Let's hope that we get there on time.
I saw him go out.
What would I do without you?
I knew we were going to be friends.
She gave up everything for her children.
What do you like about me?
I didn't ask Tom to come here.
What is that over there?
They like to be alone.
Give me a little more water.
I had to give Tom a little help.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
I thought I heard you.
I don't want to go.
I don't know how you did it.
I'm sure I can get away with it.
Don't tell Tom I'm here.
Can I see some ID?
Why don't you tell me what you remember?
I said I would help you.
I want you to help.
We love you so much.
I'm too old for you.
I know how to use this.
Never be late for school again.
Can you and I talk?
You have to believe me.
A lot of people do it.
Come the day after tomorrow.
I don't think you know anything.
How did you get in my house?
I think I'd like to be your friend.
We saw them last night.
Tom didn't have anything to say.
That's what we want to know.
I did what I could.
I know how I can do it.
Do you have a car?
I want to know what you think.
I asked Tom to leave.
Will you go with us?
I told you everything I remember.
He doesn't have any friends to play with.
I have just what you need.
I can't help you right now.
She bought him a car.
We thought that you were married.
Where did you get that?
You didn't need to buy the book.
I'd like to buy that one.
I said you could leave.
Why do you want to talk to Tom?
Tom knows how to get there.
They made us work all day.
Didn't you see the man?
She doesn't know what she really wants.
I don't know what I want to do.
He is sure that he will come.
Tom doesn't tell me anything.
I need to see him again.
Do you still love him?
She left before I got home.
That should buy us some time.
Are you going to leave?
Do you want me to go or not?
Do you really love me?
She knows where we live.
I took the children to school.
I've been looking for you all day.
We should do this every day.
Tom should have married Mary.
I don't like your name.
This is not what was asked.
Ask Tom how Mary is.
What can you do for me?
I don't feel like doing it.
I can still see you.
I came here with Tom.
No one knows for sure.
I don't have time now.
Tom doesn't know what to think.
We see him every day.
I was going to see Tom.
Tom didn't know Mary was married.
Put it where you like.
There's something I need you to do.
Why did he come with her?
I know what you're going to say.
I wanted to read them.
What would your father think?
What are you looking for?
I don't want to go out with Tom.
I was going to tell you.
You were busy last week.
I have no money today.
What do you see in Tom?
Can we please go home now?
When can I see you next time?
She does not like him.
I go to school with Tom.
She came into the room.
As long as you're here, I'll stay.
I heard that she came here.
I was about to go.
I can still remember that day.
Do you really want to know?
It's good that you're here.
Tom wants to be with Mary.
She knows who I am.
I was not a good mother.
He is better today than yesterday.
Do you ever stay home?
I thought you were my friend.
I asked Tom about his new book.
I did that all morning.
It's really not that much.
I used to work with Tom.
Why didn't she tell me?
I love you so much.
What have you come here for?
There's no way I'm going to do that.
I don't know where it is.
I will take you home.
I know what I feel.
I need to see you right away.
What time do you get to work?
He does not like us.
I need to go back to Boston.
They are my old friends.
Tom wanted to ask Mary something.
I want to be better.
I don't feel well today.
Everything he said was right.
I'd like you to go there.
Mary had to go to school.
I think you should do it.
He made good use of the money.
What did you do in there?
Are you going to buy that car?
I don't want you to do that, Tom.
I know I should stay.
I don't want to see you again.
I did all I could.
Will you go with us?
How do you say that?
I want you to come.
My mother is not always at home.
I know he did it.
I should go with you.
I think I remember you.
Tom couldn't get Mary to leave him alone.
I just wanted to see you.
She asked him to come into her house.
Why are you doing this?
Mary was looking for you at that time.
He is much better than you.
You know where Tom is, don't you?
They have nothing to eat.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about something.
Have you seen Tom's room?
I don't want to see Tom.
What do you do after school?
How did you find my house?
Why are you busy today?
I read the letter to him.
I saw you with Mary.
I remember what you said.
May I see that again?
What do you have there?
Tom doesn't want to eat.
Do you want to make some money today?
I believe his name is Tom.
We can do nothing about it.
I just need you to come with me.
I wish I had seen her.
I speak English every day.
I remember what he said.
I believe I can help you.
This one is for us.
I thought Tom would ask that.
I don't want to see you here again.
You don't have to come see me.
I'm happy to see you.
I heard what Tom said to Mary.
Tell Tom I want to see him.
I can see you don't believe me.
I will not go to school tomorrow.
I don't want to leave.
What do we need to do today?
This is what I can do for you.
He was my only friend.
Do you want to see your room?
You came out of the room.
I'm too busy to help you do that.
You don't know who I am.
I don't want to go to bed.
I don't need your job.
I know this will work.
We can't live like this.
I like you as a friend.
You're the only one who bought it.
She is not what you think she is.
Tom is just like you.
I think we need Tom.
I want to see Tom.
What more do you want from me?
You can use my help.
This book is for you.
I have never seen Tom so happy.
"I've seen that play." "So have I."
I know what the three of you want.
I know what it was.
Who told you my name?
I'll go back home with you.
How much did you see?
Tom, I want you to come with me.
Did you give Tom something to eat?
Will you come with us?
I didn't know you could do that.
Please find out where he is.
I do not understand you.
I don't feel like going out right now.
I see you remember me.
I thought I knew them.
I can't help Tom with that.
I didn't see what happened.
The problem is what to do next.
I came to see Tom.
Can you remember his name?
How long did you stay?
This is the one I want.
Tom said Mary would come.
I won't go back with you.
What day is it today?
Are we going to eat?
I don't go to school.
You had better go to bed now.
You don't have to work today.
I got up very late this morning.
I have an old car.
Do you want to do this or not?
Tom wants to be like his father.
What are you looking for in there?
You won't be late, will you?
Tom is looking for Mary.
I still want to talk to you.
How old do you think she is?
He went out to eat.
Tom gave all his money to Mary.
We're on the way home.
Now it's time to say good night.
He didn't go home yesterday.
I hope to see you again.
Now it's up to me.
Who was in the car?
Tom has been in Boston for a week.
Tell me something that I don't know.
When did he get back?
We must do something to help.
I think I know what the problem is.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.
He's the one, isn't he?
Did you want to see me?
My house is a long way from here.
Tom was my friend, too.
There were so many people.
Is Tom still too busy to see me?
I'm happy to be here.
He won't leave us alone.
What did he do after that?
What was Tom looking for?
What can I do to help you?
I can't remember how to go there.
Today is not your day.
You need to leave right now.
How are you two doing?
That will buy us some time.
I have nothing better to do.
Tell me where you live.
They made me go there alone.
Does Tom know about it?
Do you want it or not?
That has nothing to do with this problem.
Tom thought about what Mary said.
I want to be alone!
I need you to help me find it.
They made me go there.
I must help my mother.
Is that why you want to come over?
I want to be sure.
Tom doesn't understand why we're doing this.
You can't speak French, can you?
Tom doesn't have much time left.
What do they want you to do?
That's what I don't know.
They got out of the car.
I asked the man what his name was.
Tom doesn't want to go home.
I think you should buy it.
I am not happy with my job.
You like it, don't you?
We have to do it.
Why do you know that?
I wish we could go back home.
Did you really say that?
We'll see Tom next week.
What does Tom see in Mary?
I've thought about you lot.
What do you think of these people?
I don't want that one.
I don't know where Tom is.
Are you happy with your new job?
You could have told me.
She said something to him.
I had to do it.
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston.
We couldn't find the problem.
I'm not going to tell you.
You're going to want to see this.
Call her up at three.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Do you go there often?
You know how it is.
I really don't get you.
There's a lot of room in here.
You should stay away from him.
Don't look at me that way.
I never asked for it.
I just want to go to bed.
I know a lot about you.
She is at home in English.
Did you read the book I gave you?
Would you like to see it now?
I don't want to go to school today.
How did Tom know that?
Tom is out of work.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
Now I don't know what to do.
I want to help you.
Tom doesn't know where Mary is now.
I don't tell people what to eat.
He did not buy it after all.
I can do it alone.
Tom will come back. I'm sure he will.
I thought Tom was with Mary.
Did you know Tom well?
Why don't you like the way you speak?
She told him that she didn't love him.
Who knows Tom is here?
They want to go home.
Tom will have to do the work.
There's a lot to do.
We went to Boston by car.
He doesn't need to know.
When did she get married?
I don't want Tom in this room.
I didn't understand anything Tom said.
I can't speak French well.
Can we help you with something?
Do you know how to speak French?
I just don't know what to do.
I wish I could go with you today.
I couldn't believe it was you.
I want you to go.
What did you really see?
I wish that I could give you something.
Why do you like Boston?
I have seen her before.
Do you like to be alone?
How much money do you want?
I think about her often.
Tom wanted to know the time.
Why do you think that?
I need to go in.
I'd like to see them again.
I did everything for you.
Why do you want to buy this book?
Tom doesn't know anything about what happened.
I thought I told you not to come.
I still can't speak French.
I need to go eat something.
Do you want us to go with you?
I knew you wanted me.
Was that you in the car?
He is after a job.
Can I have some of these?
I don't have a lot of money.
I'll work as long as I live.
Mary is going to help us tomorrow.
Don't you have school today?
I didn't know that he was there.
I do not have any money.
Is there anything you can't do?
What does Tom think about this?
I'll tell you when we get there.
I think Tom won't go.
I'm only doing my job.
Would you like to eat something?
I'm not going to need any help.
Tom knows what he has to do.
I want to go talk to Tom.
You have to stay here.
What does it feel like?
Tom can't find what he's looking for.
I thought Tom would want to see this.
What can I do for you?
Why do you think Tom would do that?
How can Tom not understand that?
I had to go there yesterday.
What did you do with that book?
Tom wants to go to Boston.
What did Tom want to eat?
Is that what he wants?
I'd like to make more money.
What does Tom want to say to Mary?
Where do they come from?
I have it at home.
Tom doesn't know where to go.
Tom doesn't think that Mary is at home.
What did he ask you?
This won't be the last time.
Do you love him too?
I've always wanted to see your house.
I'd like you to come work for me.
I have a little something for you.
Why were you looking for Tom?
I must speak with you alone.
I'm going to read the book.
I just want to be with you.
We are at home today.
Where does Tom want you to go?
I think they know us.
How much money do you have with you?
I want to stay here with you.
Tom didn't want to talk with Mary.
Do you like to be alone?
If you're happy, so am I.
How much time will you need?
Do you have some time?
Tom wants to see Mary again.
I think they know you.
What have you come up with?
I didn't know you did that.
Do you live in Boston?
I can't tell you what happened.
Who did you think it was?
Do you know who he was?
Where did he find the money?
I will always remember you.
I told Tom to go.
He doesn't look happy to see me.
He took a day off.
I knew Tom would be back.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
They will go there with me.
Did Tom say something to you?
I can't think of his name just now.
Please don't do that again.
I can do this all day.
I have been here for a week.
Come and stay with us in Boston.
I know what I would do.
I hope you know where you're going.
Mary doesn't look like her mother.
Tom doesn't understand what you want.
I do want to go with you.
I like the way you talk.
His house is there on the right.
Do it as you are told.
What does he say in his letter?
I knew it was you, Tom.
I didn't give anything to Tom.
I did not know this.
It's not the first time.
I didn't know it was there.
Can we please go home now?
I can't remember ever doing that.
What was it that Mary bought yesterday?
Tom went to Boston to see Mary.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants.
Do you want to buy it?
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
My mother isn't at home.
Please give him a call.
Tom wants some time to think about it.
Tom had a good time in Boston.
When did you get my letter?
I saw it last night.
That's not what I said.
Do you know how to use it?
I like it so much.
We couldn't do anything for them.
I don't like it when he does that.
We don't often eat out.
Tom is the father of three children.
Tom is very happy to see Mary.
I saw what you did.
I think about him all the time.
Would you like to come?
I need a little help here.
I don't have any friends to talk with.
I don't know who he is.
I have never heard him speak English.
I said leave Tom alone.
You did not come to school yesterday.
I am in a new house.
I wanted to be just like you.
Come on, Tom, think about it.
I like what you're doing.
She knows. She always knows.
I told you everything I remember.
Do you wish to do that now?
I know what has happened.
I don't want Tom to see that.
Where are you going to put it?
He won't leave us alone.
Tom had no one to help him.
I can't live without Tom.
I want to see them.
You don't have to come here every day.
I work as much as you.
I know Tom is happy.
I know I love you.
You may be right about that.
Tom didn't want to do that.
This has been a long week.
Tell Tom we want to talk with him.
Boston is where I want to go.
I thought you didn't see anything.
I think that we should do that again.
She doesn't speak to me.
Tom doesn't want my help.
How come you are here?
Can you take me there?
It's been a long time.
I want to come in.
He doesn't really speak French.
He is still in bed.
I only told Tom what Mary told me.
Please take me away from here!
I have got to go now.
How long will this last?
Tom is very busy at this time.
Was I really that busy?
Tom wanted to see Mary.
Is there something that you want?
May I ask you something?
I know where it is.
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Tom used to go to school with Mary.
I was the only man there.
It isn't much of a car.
I'm sure you're doing all you can.
I knew Tom could do it.
How did you get in?
He did a good job.
I can't live without her.
Tell me where you live.
You must not come in.
They don't want to talk to me.
Tom is just like me.
I told him about our school.
I will need your help.
Has Tom ever been in love?
I feel like going out.
I'll leave everything to you.
Tell me where you live.
How much money do you want?
I can't leave you here alone.
We don't want to know.
This is not good at all.
You may stay here if you want to.
What are you doing here?
I've never had that problem.
I asked him about his new book.
I know that you are busy.
You know you need it.
How do I get to your house?
Do you know where Tom is from?
Do you know what day it is?
May I go home now?
Is there something I can do to help?
He is looking for a job.
I didn't want that job.
That has nothing to do with me.
She can read very well.
How long have you been busy?
Why did she do that?
They won't tell us anything.
Tom never said that he wanted to go.
What time do you get up every day?
How many more of you are there?
If you want us to help, just ask.
They could not find work at home.
We want to tell you something.
Who is in the house?
I have a lot of friends here.
I should go to bed.
Believe it or not, she has three children.
I could be away for some time.
You can't help Tom now.
What do you know about Tom?
He did it for the money.
Is that what you want to do?
I will be at home tomorrow.
Are you going to buy the car?
Leave the room as it is.
How did you come to know her?
I'd like to know for sure.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I can't tell you why Tom is late.
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
We're not going to find anything.
We're very busy just now.
Do I have to go right now?
Do you need the book?
That won't work for me.
She will come back before long.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Do you have a car?
Is that what you want me to say?
He used to live here.
I hope you like the job.
I didn't make anything to eat.
Tom didn't tell Mary everything.
No, no! That's not right.
You don't need to call me.
How do you know Tom is there?
I wish you could have been there.
I don't want to leave.
Could I look at that book?
I don't feel like doing anything today.
I was there that night.
I've got a lot to say.
I have a little money.
Were you busy last week?
Call up Tom right away.
He asked me what my name was.
Why do I have to talk to Tom?
You really don't want to know.
I will help him tomorrow.
You are better than me.
How long have you been here in Boston?
That has nothing to do with it.
Tom didn't want Mary to know.
My children are at school.
Tom doesn't want to see Mary now.
He doesn't always come late.
I don't understand what he said.
Why is Tom looking at me?
Tom was up when Mary came home.
I'm not here to help you.
I did that in school.
I asked him if he would help me.
Please give me this book.
He asked me what I had been doing.
When was your first love?
I'm going to get something to eat.
They are all very happy.
I want to know what happened to Tom.
Have you heard from him?
I know what I saw.
I wanted to speak with you about this.
I want to speak with Tom, please.
How do I know you?
I didn't know what had happened.
How old do you think Tom is?
I can't be happy here.
This is the house where I live.
Why is Tom still here?
Can you do that again?
I have to do it now.
You should know that by now.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Tom told me a lot about you.
You don't really understand, do you?
Tom doesn't really like Mary all that much.
I don't want to do it like that.
You may use my car.
I'll do more than that.
When are we going to do it?
I think your work is very good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Tom couldn't ask for more.
Look at my new car.
I got a letter from my friend.
You're the only one who can do it.
He did it as he had been told.
Would you play with me?
Can you do this problem?
Do you really want to eat that?
I don't want to go back home.
Tom is not happy about this.
I'd like to help, but I can't.
I know what I want.
Tom is going to be with Mary.
Let's talk about why you're here.
What did you tell Tom?
I need to be alone.
I can't believe Tom is really here.
Tom is as old as Mary.
You don't have to speak.
Who did you talk to?
I'm happy for the first time in life.
Do you know where I live?
Tom doesn't have many friends in Boston.
Tom doesn't like to speak French.
I just wanted to get it over with.
Tom doesn't have anything to eat.
I can't tell you everything.
We want to make sure.
Who do you live with?
I want you to come with us.
Didn't you talk to Tom?
Have any of you seen Tom?
Tom wants to talk to Mary.
I still can't believe it!
I don't know French that well.
I bought this for Tom.
I didn't want to tell Tom about this.
They know what we did.
I told Tom that I was busy.
How are you two doing?
I hope you know what you're doing.
I came back home late.
You remember Tom, don't you?
No one will ever find you.
I don't live in Boston.
Is there something I should know?
I just made it up.
Tom doesn't know what he's doing, does he?
I did that last night.
It's something I don't need.
You do what you can.
This was not the only problem.
If you want to go, we'll go.
I know as little as you do.
How do you like Boston?
I'm sure Tom could help us.
It's a really good book.
She did the work alone.
He has nothing to do with it.
We are happy to see you again.
I'm too busy to help you do that.
I know he did it.
I don't want you to go home.
We had a very good time last night.
I want to eat it.
We'll go a week from today.
I don't want to talk with you.
I don't want to see you.
Tell me what to do with it.
Why didn't you call me up?
Do you really want to make some money?
Is there something you want to tell me?
Who will come with us?
I wish I could help.
I want to see you again.
I think there's a problem.
Why do you think he said so?
He will be back tomorrow.
I don't think it's time.
I can't eat anything today.
I didn't think you were so old.
How often do you see him?
I can do it without your help.
I do not remember any of it.
I've come to talk with you again.
Where were you last night?
I'm here to ask for your help.
What do I tell Tom?
I thought Tom was there.
I didn't know what to say to him.
You have to come with me.
I need some time alone.
What will you use it for?
Did you call me up last night?
Tell me where to go.
Can't you see we're very busy?
Tell me why you want to go there.
What made her do that?
Tom bought this for me.
Tom didn't do that for us.
I want to know what that is.
It's time for us to talk.
You must stay the night.
I want Tom to know what really happened.
He is always late for school.
You don't have to eat.
What would Tom want that for?
He can do it better than I can.
How did you find that book?
I'll give you a book.
Tom bought Mary something to eat.
Won't you come with me?
I had never been late for school before.
I think you know what I think.
I think I'd want to know.
You don't need to do that.
I want to go to Boston.
Let me think this over.
What can you do for Tom?
What time do we leave tomorrow?
Do you need a car?
It's good to talk to you.
You don't need to come.
I have to tell Tom something.
How does Tom feel about it?
This is for my friend.
Tom told Mary to go home.
I want to be as happy as Tom.
I'll go take a look.
It's been so many years.
He and I are friends.
Let me know what you want to do.
That is all I know about him.
You can read anything you want.
Come when you have some time.
It's a good way to make friends.
Tom knows what's really going on.
I've got something to do.
Why did you come here today?
Can I get a dog?
I must speak to Tom about Mary.
Why don't you go play with Tom?
I'll do what I can.
May I use your car today?
She asked how his father was.
Tom wanted to know everything about Mary.
I couldn't find anything I was looking for.
Tom doesn't remember what happened.
I have to go back.
Only Tom didn't want to go.
We will go, but without you.
Why don't you tell Tom?
You made me do it.
I got something for Tom.
Ask her when she will come back.
I want you to take me to Tom.
Tom doesn't understand what's going on.
Here is the book you are looking for.
It's a long way from here to school.
There's no one by that name here.
Tom is much better than you.
They have been married two years.
I really want to help you.
Do you speak French, too?
I want to understand Tom.
Let's come back here again tomorrow.
I got a call from the school today.
First, let me ask you this.
Tom is here in Boston with me.
I was out all day.
I need French for my job.
What time did you get here this morning?
That isn't something I want to do.
Do you feel any better today?
I knew Tom very well.
She married him last year.
I couldn't find anything I was looking for.
He has been like a father to me.
I have to go there for my father.
Tom didn't have much money.
Do you think it will work?
What were you doing this morning?
Tom will go there tomorrow.
What has that to do with me?
I told Tom to stay still.
I saw him last week.
Tom put the children to bed.
I don't know what we can do.
What was it that you gave him?
How long do we have to stay here?
You can let Tom go.
Not all of us can speak English.
I hope it's not Tom.
I wish I could go with you today.
Did you find your book?
Tom took the morning off.
Do you have any money?
How old is your dog?
Tom wanted you to know.
Let me have a look at it.
I have a job for you.
You know what I want you to say.
What did you do this week?
Are you sure you can do this?
You know where I'll be.
I go to school with him.
Why don't we just stay in?
Tom doesn't want Mary to go to Boston.
Tom bought it for me.
I asked Tom to do it.
If you don't understand, ask.
She used to love him.
What is he doing now?
I eat here all the time.
I should tell you something.
What am I here for?
I have to see this.
I didn't know where to go.
Do you still really want to go?
What do I do next?
Tom never knew what happened.
I just don't want to do it again.
Ask Tom if he can speak French.
I really can't be late.
Tom doesn't think that Mary is right.
I have nothing to do with them.
Tell them what I told you.
I'm going to take a look.
Please come and see me any time.
How did you know that he is married?
I know why Tom isn't here today.
Where are you going the day after tomorrow?
Tom saw me give Mary some money.
Why did you give Tom so much money?
I don't want to tell you.
I came to talk to Tom.
He's not one of us.
We must go to school.
I didn't tell you everything.
Do you want me to go without you?
I thought we had more time.
She is everything to him.
I knew Tom a long time.
I'll be at home all day tomorrow.
This isn't the first time this has happened.
It was a busy morning.
Do you want to see it?
They know where we are.
Didn't you read the book?
No one wants to go there.
Have you ever been in love?
Tom is like a brother to me.
Did Tom see what happened?
You did all you could.
He isn't at home, is he?
Tom must have seen where Mary went.
Tom and Mary just got married last year.
He did not want her to leave.
This is an old book.
I speak a little French.
You can't live without water.
I need some time to think about it.
I wish I could do more.
I don't think it's good.
Do you need to go?
Tom is a good father.
Tom doesn't want you to do that.
He used to love her.
I want to speak French.
What should I do now?
What did they say happened?
I wanted you to come.
Tom doesn't know who I am.
Today I came to work by car.
I think that you're right.
Do you have school today?
Tell me what Tom said.
I don't want to leave Tom alone.
You don't know what it is, do you?
I don't want Tom to talk to Mary.
I don't know where I should go.
Were you at school at that time?
I wish I had married her.
What time do you go to work?
Are you really too busy?
Get out of my bed.
Tom told me why he didn't like Mary.
Tom doesn't live in Boston now.
How can we get in?
I can't put up with him.
I have to find my dog.
Tom was there that night.
I don't like any of them.
You have to do as I say.
What are you all doing?
I very much want to speak with you.
Tom can't help you now.
I don't want to see you.
Have you seen this man?
Tom was like a father to me.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
I want you to stay here with her.
Tom wants to be friends with Mary.
If you wish, you can go.
I have to eat, too.
They don't know me there.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
Tom doesn't remember my name.
Why couldn't you tell me?
I feel a lot better now.
As long as there's life, there is hope.
Can you please help me?
What do you want to do in Boston?
Give it to me now.
Tom is from Boston and so is Mary.
Let's not do the work.
I don't want to give you my money.
I gave Tom all my money.
What did you see next?
You want to talk, don't you?
I want to help you, but I can't.
What does Tom have to say?
Can I have one of these?
Tom wants you to do it.
You don't need to work today.
I don't want that one.
This is going to take years.
I will do anything for you.
Tom said that to me before.
What is going on here?
I don't think this is a problem.
May I ask how old you are?
I don't need your money.
What do you need this money for?
This is for my friend.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I'll never be like you.
I don't remember anything about them.
Help me and I'll help you.
I want you to do something for me.
I need a new car.
Tom has no problem with that.
Are you sure you don't want this?
I didn't know you were home.
I got married and had children.
I hope that you are good.
Do you want me to call back?
We want to talk to Tom.
There's a call for you. It's Tom.
Do you know how to do that?
We got into the car.
Tom doesn't know what to do.
I'm not going to need to do that.
That's not what I want.
He gave him a book.
Is there anything I can do?
I hope to see you tomorrow.
We wanted to talk about Tom.
I think we need help.
Please remember what I tell you.
You can call us at any time.
I know next to nothing.
I can't tell you what to do.
Tell me what I want to know.
Why do you think it happened?
What do you want to buy?
What more could one ask for?
Tom doesn't look too happy.
Tom had never seen Mary so happy.
Tom isn't sure where to go.
How long have you been in Boston?
I like to be at home.
My home is your home.
Do you want me to stay?
Do you know when she will come?
Don't you know what happened yesterday?
The problem was too much for me.
I thought I'd never see you again.
You have to do it.
I don't want to go home.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I will not let you do it.
I don't want you to go to Boston.
There's no one like you.
Tom is never on time.
I have to call my father.
What does she look like?
No one told me about that.
I was going to do that.
I want to see them again.
I would do anything for you.
I have no problem with this.
I used to live here.
I have something to talk over with you.
Tom can't always get what he wants.
We don't need your money.
I heard everything you said.
I made friends with her.
I don't have any money.
Do you want to see her very much?
It's too late for you.
I didn't speak with Tom.
I can't give Tom everything he wants.
I'd like you to help me.
Tom told Mary not to be late.
Tom wants Mary to be happy.
Won't you speak to Tom about it?
I know why that is.
What did you do today?
I just made that up.
Why won't Tom help us?
I'll go back to Boston.
Every dog has his day.
Could you tell what he said?
Don't tell me you didn't know.
I think you should talk to Tom.
The people who live there are our friends.
I want to know who you are.
Does Tom still live in Boston?
I think that he is right.
I'm going to call him right now.
Tom doesn't know if Mary will come tomorrow.
I'd do anything for you, Tom.
I think I have had one too many.
I didn't know what to think.
She made her mother happy.
I don't have much money.
I can't come with Tom.
Tom doesn't have to go to school today.
She will be here in no time.
I always speak French with Tom.
How long have you been in Boston?
I take back everything I said.
Who did you buy this for?
I hope you got what you need.
I can't stay here long.
We need a little time alone.
Isn't there anything you want to tell me?
I'm looking for my friends.
Tom used up all his money.
I had to go back to Boston.
I have nothing to live for.
I know you don't remember me.
I wish there were more people like you.
Well, I have to be going.
I know why Tom is doing that.
We're the only people here.
I need to talk to Tom first.
Tom left some money for Mary.
Would you please come over here?
He came here to help me.
I was told Tom would be here.
Are you going to do something about it?
Do you know where I can find it?
He can't have read this book.
If only I could speak English!
How will you get to school tomorrow?
One can always find time.
I need my car for my job.
Tom said that you wanted to see me.
Who did you come with?
Would you like to have a look?
I want you to go with Tom.
Why do I have to tell Tom?
You should get to school.
Do you think I should go alone?
I have a little money now.
I don't know what happened to Tom.
I was here all the time.
What time do you go to bed?
Why did Tom come back?
"Where is your house?" "It is over there."
I know what he did.
We have no school tomorrow.
I thought you didn't want to come.
Put it where you like.
Don't make me go back there.
You have a right to be happy.
No one will speak with me.
I feel so happy today.
Why did you let Tom go?
Please tell me when to leave.
When did he say he would come?
What do you have on for tomorrow night?
Tom does a good job.
Tom is out of work.
I'm never going to get married.
Do you eat at home or eat out?
Tom and Mary are at work now.
Will we see Tom again?
I want you to find Tom.
Where does this book go?
What made you come here?
I'm on my way home.
Believe that if you want to.
First of all, I must say this.
Why do I have to talk to Tom?
Can I go to work?
I'm not the only one who did that.
Tom said he knew where Mary was going.
I speak French every day at work.
This is not about money.
She was asked to give him some money.
I want you out of my house.
Tom said Mary was good at French.
I love my mother very much.
Why don't we take a look?
I have work to do now.
I thought we had a good time.
That's what happened the last time.
I went there to see her.
I've never seen one before.
Don't go in my room.
There's no one in the room.
He has much more money than I have.
Don't you want to know what happened?
She was the first one to help him.
You got here late, didn't you?
I would do anything for love.
We came back by way of Boston.
Get out of my bed.
We can't help you with that.
Tom asked me what the problem was.
I didn't do it for Tom.
Tom doesn't know if Mary will come.
Is he going to make it?
I know what the children are looking at.
How did Tom find out?
I thought a lot about what you said.
I have often been there.
He could get no more money.
Do you still love him?
She is like a mother to me.
Yesterday I bought a book.
I don't like my job.
What time do we leave tomorrow?
Are you happy or not?
I will tell you tomorrow.
I love you more than anything.
I don't want to ever see you again.
I have read the book.
Can you tell me the time?
I don't have any money.
I don't have any money.
Do you know anything about this?
I still don't see it.
Tom knew Mary was right.
I was the only man.
What did I tell you?
That was what Tom told Mary.
I don't know for sure.
I took a day off last week.
You should take a day off.
You don't have to believe me.
You can't ask us to do nothing.
I know who it is.
I just need a little time.
I want to go back to my room.
Could you please take me back home?
Let me go with you.
Let me know what you find out.
I think Tom knows why.
Tom doesn't want to talk about it.
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help.
I need to speak to you.
I wish there were more people like you.
I know why Tom is here.
How long did you stay?
I wanted us to be happy.
Did you have a good time?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Tom asked Mary what her last name was.
I do not know any of them.
I'm much better today than yesterday.
He has no house to live in.
I think what you're doing is right.
How do we do it?
I speak French as well as she does.
I didn't know you were here.
Are we good to go?
Yesterday, I bought a book.
I want you to talk to Tom.
Let's talk about why you're here.
I'm Tom and this is Mary.
How old are the children?
I know you want to make me happy.
I don't have any money.
I want to give you something.
You don't have to go there.
I don't know what to do about it.
I thought I'd never go back.
Did you really do that?
Tom never saw Mary again.
Tom has been in Boston for a week.
We have to get out of here.
I thought Tom would let me go.
Can I do something for you?
I want him to leave.
I didn't think it would be that much.
Do they know about us?
Have you seen this man?
This isn't the first time this has happened.
It's too late for them.
Tom couldn't get the job he wanted.
Do you understand what he's told you?
Are you sure you don't want to go?
Do you really want to go?
I want you to stay away from Tom.
You don't have to believe me.
I've come here to work with Tom.
There won't be a next time.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come back.
When does she come home again?
I have something to give to you.
He gave it a new name.
Do you really want to go?
Do you have the book?
We must not be late.
How much more money do we need?
That's what I told her.
Tom and Mary are at home today.
He doesn't need to work.
Tell them to come here.
You know where I'll be.
I'll talk with you when I'm not busy.
Tom just wanted to be happy.
Don't call us, we'll call you.
Tom said he didn't want anything.
Do you want my help?
This is what you must do.
I go to school every day.
Tom wants to see us.
I need a better job.
Do I need to be here tomorrow?
Don't ask me for money.
You don't know what you're doing.
You can come with us.
Do you want to eat?
What do you want to eat?
Why are you so happy?
Tom told Mary that he didn't love her.
I don't know what to tell you.
I know about the job.
What do you think they want?
Can you give me some money?
I was just about to go home.
Tom told me why he didn't like Mary.
How long will it take to get there?
I could not get out.
How do you know Tom?
Why are they doing this?
Can I see that one?
I never had a car.
I have nothing to do today.
What do you think you're doing?
I didn't give it to you.
I happened to know her name.
I know what Tom did to Mary.
He can speak a little English.
Did you read it all?
I think about Tom all day.
I know that you live here.
Tom is a very busy man.
Why don't we go in?
Did you tell Tom about it?
I will help as much as I can.
You will need time to understand.
I don't want to go to school today.
Tom heard that Mary got a job.
I really don't know much about that.
I can't believe you're really here.
Could you make room for me?
Can I have one of these?
I knew that was Tom.
I go right home after work.
That's going to be a problem.
I don't want to speak about her.
I have to help my mother.
I never could do it.
You should come out with us.
Where do you think Tom is?
Do you need much money?
There's still a lot to do.
I often get a letter from him.
She got out of the car.
I had to help Tom.
I don't really know you.
Tom doesn't know that I know.
I want to live in Boston.
Please give me something to eat.
They want to get married.
Why should you think so?
I can't do this alone.
Tom doesn't know Mary very well.
You're the one that I was looking for.
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
Please get me out of here.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Tom doesn't remember very much.
I know what I did.
That's not what I was looking for.
Tom wants to leave, but he can't.
Don't you want to know where it's from?
I think you're going to need this.
I know why he did it.
I speak English a lot.
That is the book I want to read.
Do you want to know what I think?
I have no home to live in.
Would you like me to help you?
I don't want to remember.
I didn't know you were from Boston.
I wish I was like him.
How did you find my house?
I have just what you need.
I know your brother very well.
I just got here this morning.
Please don't leave me alone.
I don't want Tom's help.
Do you know how I can get there?
I want you to help Tom.
Do you want my help?
I thought Tom had a dog.
I want to buy a new car.
He has no house to live in.
I was happy to see her again.
Will you take me there?
Do you have anything to say?
It's not really up to me.
What was he doing there?
Tom must be from Boston.
Tom doesn't need to know.
I don't want to read it.
Did you buy this book?
I used to live in Boston.
Don't make me do this.
I'm so happy for you, Tom.
I have to go home.
I need to know where to put this.
I don't know what Mary is looking for.
Please book a room for her.
I don't know if you remember me.
I saw your brother the other day.
We made a good buy.
So you're a man after all.
I think that you should go.
Tom is in love with Mary.
Where would you like to go?
I'm very sure I have to do that.
If you want, you can go.
Why do you have to do it?
I don't want that one.
Won't you come and see me next week?
We can't let Tom do that.
I want to talk to Tom about Mary.
I hope it went well.
Get used to it, Tom.
What did you do this time?
I wanted to speak with you first.
Can you help me a little?
I wish he were here now.
Can you go with us?
I have to help Mary.
Tom was the only man in the room.
I want something to eat.
I don't speak any French.
I have time, so I'll do it.
Is that a new car?
Tom is really in love with Mary.
He wants you to stay here.
What can I do to help you?
Tom asked Mary for some money.
May I come and see you tomorrow?
I will stay home today.
I want to see him.
Are you still there, Tom?
You didn't have to do this.
Did you really not know that?
You can ask him for help.
Tom is in there alone.
Isn't that why you're here?
Why did I not know this?
It's too late for me.
Can I do something to help you?
It's time to put the children to bed.
I really don't want to live here.
I'm not sure I want the job.
How did you get into my house?
You did tell Tom about that, right?
Tom won't be happy to see you.
What do you want to talk about?
I have been busy this week.
I have to give this book to Mary.
When did you get back?
We know that Tom is here.
He isn't happy at all.
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
How do you know Tom is there?
Where are you off to?
Tom asked me to do it.
I'm not sure I want the job.
I believe Tom is right.
Tom didn't say anything at all.
Do you think Tom saw Mary?
Are you sure about this?
Let's hope next year will be better.
I am married and have two children.
Why didn't you help me?
He is often late for school.
I think of her day and night.
I'll never leave you alone again.
It's better as it is.
I'd like to go out with her.
I think I'd better stay here.
How old is your dog?
We have nothing to talk about.
Give me just a little.
She wants him to be just a friend.
I didn't think of that.
I don't want this one.
She will be back before long.
How long did it last?
Tom doesn't understand what you said.
I want to tell you what happened.
It's not a problem at all.
I don't do it for money.
Please don't leave me alone.
I just need to know what happened.
I didn't ask you to come here.
Tom doesn't want Mary to go.
I'm never late for school.
I didn't know much about Tom.
Are you sure you don't want it?
I wish I had a friend like you.
This is what he said.
Do you like the new school better?
I'm looking for work, too.
It's not why I'm here.
Tom has to look for a job.
Get it out of the house.
Do you think he will really give up?
I'm going to leave you.
We want to tell you something.
Tom knows the man Mary came with.
That's where we saw Tom last year.
Why would you want it?
Is that all Tom told you?
Tom did what he had to do.
I'm happy that Tom is happy.
This was a good book.
I am going to school.
Tom thought I was you.
Where did you see them?
Do you know where Tom is?
You're the only one who bought it.
I don't know who should do that.
Tom doesn't do much, does he?
You can come if you want to.
How can Tom not understand that?
How did you come by the money?
All of you have to read it.
I had a problem with my car.
I didn't know you were busy.
Do you need to leave today?
I know who she is.
Tom knows what you did.
What are you two doing?
Is Tom in Boston now?
Do you think it will work?
I don't ever want to see Tom again.
I live in Boston now.
I don't want to get married.
I'm the one that has to do that.
What do you want to do in Boston?
I'd like to think so.
I could be of help.
Is that too much to ask?
How did you ever get out of it?
Don't let him do it alone.
I don't believe she would understand.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will leave Boston.
Tom knew what Mary wanted him to do.
I won't tell you why I did that.
I remember how he used to be.
I can't work with Tom.
Stay out of my way!
Did Tom buy that for Mary?
Do you want to talk to Tom?
He was not just a father to me.
I want to believe that.
How did you find it?
I don't want to do it like that.
Tom and Mary are very happy.
Do you want to see Tom again?
That's what Tom told me.
Just leave it to me.
I'm too busy to see Tom.
Tom got a letter from Mary today.
Tom wants us to know he did it.
Can I go home now?
Don't you want to stay here with us?
Is this what you want?
When did you come back from Boston?
Where did he come from?
Where did you see them?
I had to go there alone.
I always knew Tom would come back.
You had better not do that.
You know very well what I want.
She doesn't need to work.
Tom wanted us to see it.
Do you know what Tom wants?
It's not going very well.
Tom doesn't know any French.
Isn't there something you can do to help?
I will not let you do it.
What time did you get here this morning?
I didn't ask for your help.
How can you not remember?
There is no water in the well.
I thought Tom would want it back.
Tom thought about Mary a lot.
We had no help from Tom.
Where do you want me to put this?
He is the very man I want.
You don't have the time.
I'm doing it for Tom.
When did they go home?
Tom asked Mary to come to Boston.
If I have time, I'll do it.
I was going to call Tom.
I still don't believe it!
She came home very late.
Get out of my house.
I'm not in love with Mary.
I have to let you go.
We were told not to do that.
I must buy one of these.
I don't want to go out.
How can Tom not understand this?
What time do you go to bed?
You never tell me anything.
I'm on my way home.
I can get you one if you like.
You're not the one we're after.
Where are we going next?
I don't think that he's right.
Tom didn't know who Mary was at first.
It is time you went to school.
Remember that I love you.
What did Tom want Mary to do?
What you say is right.
Tom must love Mary very much.
I don't want to be your friend.
Why didn't you ask me?
I don't know where you're going.
I'm a little busy now.
When do I get to go home?
Do you want to look at this?
You're a little too old for me.
I had no money left.
I don't feel like going to school today.
No one will speak with me.
They didn't know what to do with him.
He gave it to me for nothing.
I'd like to go out with you.
Do you have to go now?
I wish I had a lot of money.
I think we'll find Tom.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
I don't want to see you again.
Remember what I told you.
I want to please you.
The money is in the well.
Next year will be better.
This is the book I want to buy.
I told her not to go.
I think I should leave.
It was just as I thought.
No one was at home.
What do you want me to ask Tom?
How did you find Tom?
She wants me to go with her.
I hope to see you.
My father is as busy as ever.
You can go if you want to.
Can you do it alone?
What did you buy it for?
Do you have a car?
He must go there tomorrow.
I think there's something here you should see.
I hope it went well.
All I wanted was to make you happy.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
Tom has something to tell Mary.
I need to go home.
How can I find Tom?
I do not remember any of it.
Tom doesn't eat a lot.
He did not buy it after all.
I am out of work.
I need to speak to Tom.
Do you have some money?
I need to see it.
I heard him go out.
How did you come by this money?
I can't understand why he did that.
I just need a little more time.
Your brother will not buy it.
I have to leave you.
I thought Tom would like it.
I don't know where Tom is.
Do you want me to take you home?
I'll do everything you tell me to do.
I hope you don't tell Tom what happened.
I thought Tom would want to know.
Please let me say something.
He couldn't get the job.
That house is much better than this.
How many people are here?
Do you know her father?
I want to know what it is first.
I know what it's about.
Tom told me he used to be married.
I did it for him.
What is the book about?
I'll talk with you when you're not busy.
I didn't do that for the money.
This house is very good.
When did you buy your car?
I hope she will get well.
Tom couldn't understand Mary at all.
I can't talk now. I'm too busy.
I saw that he came.
I don't want you to see this.
Tom said Mary was busy.
I don't remember doing that.
I did all the work.
What did you do with my book?
Tell me what you need.
Do you have something to say?
I don't like this one.
I had no one to talk to.
I came here to see Tom.
She didn't know what to do.
Tom doesn't have time to help you.
You don't want to know what I think.
I don't want to do it again.
I'll stay at home today.
We don't know anything about him.
Tom didn't come to school yesterday.
This is how I did it.
I'll tell you what I can do.
Is that why you were late?
I asked where Tom was.
How old are your children?
What do you think now?
I think we're going to need more money.
I don't want your money.
I think I'll buy a new car.
I don't know what I'll do.
How old do you think I am?
I can't find what I want.
You can live with me.
I remember it as if it were yesterday.
I don't like any of them.
Tom, I want to ask you something.
We knew them very well.
I'll find a way to do it.
There is no life without water.
I don't think he can help you.
Do you feel better now?
Can you do that again?
I just got a job.
I don't know why Tom isn't here today.
Why didn't you tell me Tom was here?
I want to eat something good.
Do you know something I don't know?
What do you really think?
I can't get over it.
I don't think Tom has too many friends.
Tom will never believe that.
I don't want to go back home yet.
I don't know when Tom will be back.
I didn't know you had a brother.
I need to know when to come.
Do you want to do it again?
I have a lot of work to do.
Do you want to do this?
I had a little help.
Tom did all that he could.
Call me if you find something.
Do you remember who I am?
Please tell us what to do next.
I'm going to have to talk to Tom.
I think he can't do that.
We can do so much better.
You know I love you!
Tom never saw her again.
How does she do it?
I'll be there all day.
He does not have to do this.
Does he know that you love him?
What good would it do?
I didn't do that well.
I have nothing to live for.
I want us to be friends.
You have a problem there.
What took Tom so long?
I wish I could help.
Tom wanted Mary to leave right away.
Where do you use French?
I just want to help Tom.
Tom doesn't want to be here.
Do you have a lot of time?
I want you to look at something.
I really love my work.
We do not know him.
I want to know what time to come.
There's no need to see them off.
I want to go to school.
I know where she is.
Would you tell me when to get off?
I only have two children.
How did you get to know him?
I'll call Tom for you.
I wish I could go.
No one will know I'm here.
I know what you do.
It doesn't look good at all.
What do you know about him?
Tom must have heard about what happened.
How long will you stay here?
You have to speak only English.
I must speak with you.
I'll always be your friend.
Where did you put my book?
Do you think I need to go?
I'll believe it when I see it.
Would you like to eat?
How much time do you need?
What are you looking at?
We didn't understand anything you said.
What did you do there?
She has to look after her mother.
I'm going to give it to Tom.
How much more do we need?
You don't need to call me.
Did you buy a dog?
You have to leave Boston.
Tom doesn't want to let Mary down.
May I call you back?
You can come with us.
He didn't come after all.
After work, I go right home.
I'll see you in Boston.
I'm always the last to know.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
We have no school today.
Tom has to speak French at work.
I think you should tell Tom that.
I want to know what's going on here.
I don't believe she would understand it.
When will you come back to school?
Can we go back now?
They didn't know what to do first.
You can't do that here.
I know about you two.
She asked him to give her some money.
That's why I like you.
You asked to see me.
Tell me what I need to do.
He was a good friend.
I thought he was my brother.
See you next week, Tom.
Call me up when you get there.
I've got something for you.
You understand me very well.
I will speak with you tomorrow.
Tom isn't the man he used to be.
"Where is your house?" "It is over there."
Why do you want to come with me?
Do you see what I see?
I have to work tomorrow.
I told you to stay put.
I hope you like this.
Well, what do you want me to say?
What do you use this for?
I thought you were right.
I know what it's about.
Do you have anything to read?
Could you please help me?
I remember how he used to be.
My friends don't know where I am.
You don't talk a lot, do you?
No one can know everything.
There's no one but me here.
I wish you didn't do that.
When did you get to Boston?
I need to know what's going on.
Was Tom in on it?
Can't you buy a car?
Do you want to say something?
Won't you speak to Tom about it?
She wants me to help her.
Tom had no friends to play with.
Did you call me up last night?
I didn't need to tell him.
I asked Tom to help Mary.
Can't you do something to help me?
Good to see you, Tom.
I know when I'm not wanted.
What was he doing when you saw him?
She is not home, but at school.
I don't want any more.
I told you I'd think of something.
Today is not good for me.
I will always remember you.
I can't take Tom's money.
How old is that dog?
You never tell me anything.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
Tom is looking for a better job.
Can you find your way all right?
Do you want to talk about what happened?
Let me know if you need more.
You like English, don't you?
I should go to Boston.
I'm not sure about it.
What are you two doing?
Tom couldn't find anything better to do.
My father will help me.
Tom came back to Boston last year.
We didn't see any children at all.
We have to do something, Tom.
I hope you know what this is.
I go to school every morning.
Call up Tom right away.
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
She did not say anything.
She does not have much money.
To make money one must want money.
He did what I told him to do.
You can take your time.
My father is as busy as ever.
Please ask him to call me.
I wanted to talk with you.
My father bought me the book.
I think we'll need more money.
I didn't ask him for anything.
What time will you be back?
What did you do with that money?
He won't live more than one day.
Do you like your new job?
May I talk with you?
Tom did this to me.
Didn't I give you some money?
When did you get back?
She was there in the morning.
There's no one in the room.
Is that what you really want to do?
I think it's time for me to leave.
I really do have to go.
I'd like to know what you're doing.
I've got to see it.
Tell them to give it to you.
That's what I need to find out.
I didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
They are not little children.
Why don't we talk about it now?
My wish is to please you.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't know what time it is.
I'm so happy you came.
I never want to talk to you again.
Do you know the way?
Do you have many friends?
Tom didn't want to talk with Mary.
You have to go back.
They took off after Tom.
Will you come back tomorrow?
Come and see me tomorrow.
You think I don't know what's going on?
I think Tom will do that for us.
How did Tom get home?
That was what Tom wanted.
You don't remember, do you?
Do what you believe is right.
Will you please help me?
It was his first job.
He used to read at night.
He took what little money I had.
If you want to talk, talk.
What does Tom do now?
I wanted to buy the book.
What would you like to buy?
All of us like her.
I just need to know what happened.
You let me down, Tom.
They would call for help.
He's a little like his father.
Can you find your way all right?
My father doesn't really talk much.
You must be Tom's brother.
Tom doesn't know what to do first.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
He asked me where to go.
They made me go there alone.
I remember what he said.
I think of you all the time.
Does Tom still work here?
I saw Tom with Mary.
When did he come here?
What do you want to do?
Do you need me, Tom?
You are the man I've been looking for.
What more does Tom need?
Tom still doesn't know what happened.
Tom has left, but Mary is still here.
Do you think in French?
Tom could be right about that.
Let's do this first of all.
Are you in Boston now?
I didn't go to school.
What can you give me?
It's not something I'm very good at.
I'll be home alone all night.
You go there without me.
I want to see Tom now.
Please come to talk to me.
Are you going to do that?
This is all I know.
Why are you in Boston?
I have to go now.
I am a married man.
I know you did it.
I love you more than you love me.
How did you get up there?
That's what friends are for.
I told you Tom would help us out.
I've never seen that before.
I want a book to read.
I think you saw something.
I just need to know who Tom is.
I want to go back to my friends.
Tom can't tell me what to do.
I'll buy a new one.
He has bought a new car.
I've been asked to help you.
When do you go to bed?
I've come to see you.
Tom wants to speak with you.
How do I get to your house?
How does he do it?
I told Tom what you did.
You may use my new car.
How old is this dog?
Do you want my help?
Is there anything I can do?
This is what we want to know.
I don't think we have much time.
How many children do you have?
I just don't love Tom.
You should stay in bed.
What do you think I've been doing?
Would you like any more?
What did you do at school today?
I don't want to go back to Boston.
I want to see everything.
He can speak French well.
Why do you think Tom would do that?
He has money, but he's not happy.
I will stay at home.
I just thought you were happy.
We have to tell them.
Tom is going to do something about it.
I know what his name is.
I am going to buy a new car.
What's my book doing here?
Why did I do that?
Tom won't tell Mary anything.
Tom didn't know who to believe.
You have some money, don't you?
I know that he's Tom.
Let's talk about the problem.
You know how busy we are.
There was no one about.
It's time to go now.
We are about to leave here.
We didn't think of that.
I just don't know what to say.
Tom isn't one of them.
They told me to stay in the car.
If you can, come with us.
He didn't go to school.
How long have we been married?
I don't think Tom will be back.
He came again after a week.
Does that make you happy?
I think now is the time.
Who are you and why are you here?
I'm not sure I believe you.
I've had a busy morning.
Do you know all these people?
We're on the way home.
I didn't have time for that.
All Tom did was eat.
You're the only one who can help me.
I eat here every day.
I am looking for my brother.
Tom wanted me to help you.
Do you feel better now?
You never let me do anything.
I was very busy today.
What about the other one?
Do you want to read?
Did Tom ask about me?
We don't want you here.
This is something I need to do alone.
I'm a little busy here.
I can do it alone.
Why do you want this?
She wanted him to help her father.
Tom is never on time.
I want us to be friends.
At first I didn't like it.
Tom doesn't know my name.
When did you see them first?
I was with friends all last night.
That's what I really want.
I didn't know where you were.
I'm going to get married.
Do you think I should go alone?
What do you want me to do now?
"I'll do it tomorrow." "You said that yesterday!"
Without water, you could not live.
Don't make me ask you again.
What is he up to now?
May I do it right now?
Well, I must be going.
Give me time to think it over.
I love you more than I love her.
How should I know where he is?
Tell me you love me.
I still want to be here.
What do I need to do now?
What time do you go to bed?
Tom didn't want Mary to work.
Does he know what you did?
I don't know her at all.
I don't think Tom wants to see me.
Why don't you like me?
I think I'd like to be alone.
You know who we are.
Your dog is over there.
I need to see my father.
Why didn't you think of that before?
This is the only book I have.
I had a good time, too.
What do you want now?
Please tell me where you will live.
She so wants to go.
I can do my job without your help.
I always think of him when I'm alone.
Are you sure you can't come with me?
She knows who he is.
I'd like to think Tom is a friend.
I know now what I have to do.
I'd better be on my way.
It did not come off.
Tom doesn't want to be seen here.
We know what we want.
They had had that problem before.
Please give him a call.
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
I will give you this book.
Tom should still be in bed.
I know Tom did it.
Don't you have any friends?
What does Tom think about this?
Did you find what you were looking for?
That will be all for today.
What did you do with that car?
I thought he was here.
Tom wants to see Mary.
Does Tom know what you're doing?
I don't think Tom will be back.
I'm doing this for you.
Tom didn't want to get out of bed.
I had to let Tom go.
I want to tell you something.
I don't think Tom wants to leave.
We just want you to be happy.
I just got back home.
Tom was often late for school.
I have a job for you.
You know why I'm here, right?
How did you get in my house?
I'm not one of them.
I'll talk to Tom in the morning.
You're just like your father.
I'm going to go back to Boston.
What did you do this morning?
Tom should still be at work.
I know what love is.
I'd like to see him.
Ask her when she will come back.
I know why you want it.
Get out of my car.
What must you do now?
It's time to go to school.
Tom must be up to something.
What day is it again?
Could you please take me home?
I know where she is.
What is Tom doing here?
That's what I want to know.
He has just bought a used car.
No one really knows what's going on.
I'll do it my way this time.
I don't want anything from you.
I want to see you again.
He's married and has three children.
I didn't really feel like going out.
Have you told me everything?
Why don't you ask Tom?
It's not that at all.
I would like you to come with me.
I can't go with you.
You must be a friend of Tom's.
We see what we want to see.
I don't want a job in Boston.
We need money to do anything.
Tom has never been to Boston.
It's about time I was going home.
There's something here I want you to see.
Tom didn't want to talk.
What did Tom call me?
We all want you to be happy.
I want to do it again.
You will never be alone.
I want to ask you about Tom.
I say what I think.
I will never do it again.
Should I make something up?
I want you to stay with me.
I know where he is.
All I want is to be left alone.
Tom didn't want Mary to leave.
Why did you call me?
Why won't you believe me?
I don't have any money.
How much money does he have?
Please leave everything to me.
We know Tom did it.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is like.
What time did you get here this morning?
Tom wants to see you.
She said that she was happy.
Do you like to be alone?
Why don't you call him up?
Do you want to buy something or not?
Tom doesn't want to see you.
That's where the problem is.
Tom came all the way from Boston.
Let's do what Tom said.
You may stay here if you want to.
We still have a lot to do.
Many friends came to see me off.
I think we have more work to do.
Are you happy with how you look?
What do I have to do?
This is our friend Tom.
What do you think it was for?
Let's talk about this when I get home.
Do you want him to know about it?
I think we do a really good job.
I believe I can help you.
You did tell Tom about that, right?
Tom doesn't go to a good school.
Tom asked for some more time.
Tom had a very good night.
Do we have a problem?
I wish I'd been there.
I don't know what it's like yet.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted to.
He has nothing to do.
What time did you eat?
Why did Tom call you?
I will take over your job.
She has a lot of work to do.
Tom has to go see Mary.
I don't want to be up all night.
I had never seen so much money.
Please don't make me ask Tom.
Don't think I don't like you.
I'm the only one who knows them.
Don't do anything like that again.
Where did you find it?
I don't know his name.
See you tomorrow at school.
What did he do yesterday?
Tom did a very good job.
Tom came to see you.
He did everything for her.
Why do you want to go to Boston?
Tom knew what he was doing.
What did you do to Tom?
Why is it that you're always late?
Can you please help me?
I've never seen anything like it.
I'm in love with you.
Didn't I ask you not to help?
I just need more time with Tom.
What do you think of Tom?
My friend wants to talk to you.
Tom has more money than I do.
I can't believe I let Tom do that.
Do you want to look into it?
Tom is not the problem.
I don't know very much about Boston.
Is there no other way?
You should take a day off.
They were all friends as children.
He was alone in the room.
Don't look into my room.
That's what I want to find out.
Do I have to go now?
Don't ask them where they are going.
I just knew you would say that.
What more can you say?
Tom has too much work to do.
Tom is better than us.
You stay away from her.
Tom doesn't want to tell Mary everything.
What are you doing that for?
Would you like me to do that work?
He gave her a book.
What Tom really wanted was to be happy.
This is all he has to do.
I don't know if I have the time.
How do you do it?
It just doesn't work that way.
Let's go see how Tom is doing.
I'm doing it for Tom.
If that's so, all the better.
I can speak English a little.
I'll see you in there.
I can get you more.
Are you still in Boston?
What were you doing about this time yesterday?
I know what Tom is doing.
I never want to see you again.
He didn't like her at first.
Why did you stay at home yesterday?
Do you feel all right today?
Tom couldn't understand Mary at first.
Tom thought no one was at home.
Tom wanted us to see it.
I'm not sure I know what to do.
We just want to take Tom home.
I did that at school.
We didn't need to do that.
Do you really want to know?
Have you ever really been in love?
I'm not going to make it on time.
I thought Tom would never see you again.
How did it go last night?
She bought a new car.
I hope that I'll see her.
When my children are happy, I'm happy.
Speak to me in English.
It's time to call it a night.
There are a lot of people here.
I've got a long way to go.
Tom doesn't know what to do now.
I don't know where Tom is.
Tom thought Mary was busy.
Do you want to eat?
I'm too old for this.
Who does he work for?
Why did you want Tom to leave?
Isn't that an English book?
Please do this for me.
I want you to be my friend again.
Tom couldn't speak French well.
You could have been happy.
I need a new car.
I do not know how to use it.
I will help you all I can.
I would like to tell you something.
We know so little about Tom.
That's going to take a lot time.
I can't talk with people.
I think about him all the time.
I just don't know what to say.
Please tell me where you got this.
Tom doesn't think Mary can live without him.
I wanted you so much.
I'll be there right away.
Do you want me to tell you why?
He asked me who I was.
You don't have to stay.
I don't have anything to give you.
I told Tom to stay away from Mary.
Tom didn't want my help.
I'd like to go out with her.
Will you let me see you again?
I just got back from school.
What we need is help.
I knew Tom would be there.
I just need to see Tom.
We can't help Tom now.
You're going to get better.
I'm not here to help you.
Why do you want to leave?
This isn't the first time this has happened.
What time is it there?
I know Tom is in there.
I have to go talk to Tom.
Tom said he saw nothing.
I have to do something.
You can't come in with this.
Tom wants you to take us to school.
There's a lot of work to do.
The old man asked me the time.
She told me she knew my brother.
That's all I have to say.
I can't remember her name.
How long do I have to stay here?
I am about to leave here.
Tom and Mary did what they were told.
I'm not going to go there.
I'll see you when I get back.
What are you up to?
Don't give me that look.
Would you tell me the time, please?
My father is too old to work.
Tom has very little money.
How will you get back?
No one was in the car.
I know you can do this.
Look, I know you're busy.
When did you come back from Boston?
This is how it happened.
Let's talk about what happened.
I told Tom he should go.
I told Tom not to come.
I need to get to work.
Tom went there to talk to Mary.
You go to school, right?
You can have it for nothing.
I want to go to bed.
I was told I couldn't do that.
We'll go back to Boston next week.
Tom didn't have to do that.
Tom couldn't understand anything Mary said.
What am I doing here?
I'm looking for my brother.
We don't have it right now.
There's still so much to do.
Could you just take me home, please?
I wish I had a lot of money.
Where were you that day?
I used to like Boston.
I won't live like that.
You have to stay here.
You can read this book.
He is the father of three children.
You know who I am.
I don't want to know his name.
Can you say that again?
He gave me all his money.
I know you won't do it.
Who would do something like this?
This is our friend Tom.
Tom couldn't find what he was looking for.
Is there a letter for me?
Did you get me anything?
Isn't it about time to eat?
Tom doesn't want to believe that.
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
Tom was a good man.
He's a friend from work.
I don't know where I am.
I think that's why Tom is here.
How do you say "love" in French?
Do you want to come?
I must help these people.
This is how we do it.
He can't speak English, can he?
I need to get something for Tom.
We have everything we need.
I wish I were there right now.
He went into the water before me.
Get us out of here.
Please do something about it.
What did you do yesterday?
I leave in the morning.
Tom never wanted to see Mary again.
I knew Tom was no good.
I'll be at home in the morning.
Take this book back to him.
What have you heard, Tom?
You like her, don't you?
I see Tom every day.
I saw her last week.
We'll do it this way from now on.
I'll tell you what I want to do.
I remember what I saw.
You remember that, don't you?
I wish you were here with me now.
We had a really good time.
I only know him by name.
Her mother has made her what she is.
Do they live with you?
You may as well come with me.
I want to speak to Tom alone.
What time do you go to bed?
Tom didn't have to go to work today.
How did Tom do this?
It's too late for him.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about it.
Why should I believe that?
I'd like to know what you think.
What did you do yesterday?
If you need any help, ask me.
Give us what we want.
He knows who we are.
Where did you find this?
It is too late for me.
Tom went to Boston for a week.
Did you get what you wanted?
I didn't know what to do after that.
I need to buy one.
I'd like some more water.
Tom didn't want to go.
We have a lot of friends.
Where did you see Tom?
Tom couldn't believe what Mary said.
I never want to see you again.
I don't know what has happened to him.
What took you so long?
Tom wants to buy a house.
I knew you were going to ask that.
We really have to go back to Boston.
Tom doesn't know what I'm going to do.
I know Tom is your friend.
I like the way you talk.
What was it that he was looking for?
I know who you all are.
I need you to help me.
I didn't come with Tom.
Something is better than nothing.
This is not about money.
Do you want to leave it like that?
I've got a lot of work to do.
Why were you in Boston?
Why don't I call you?
It just was not my day yesterday.
I heard your father isn't doing well.
She knows what to do now.
I want you to know something.
I don't know how to go there.
That's what people don't understand.
I was there last night.
Do you want to know who did this?
I'll never leave you alone again.
How could Tom not like me?
I want to think about it.
What should I do next?
After that, he went home.
We had a little water.
How long will this take?
May I see that again?
What are you so happy about?
I just want to help.
Why does Tom want to find us?
Tom is going to be happy here.
I'm too old for her.
Tom knew that Mary was busy.
You can do it, can't you?
They made us work all night.
Can I have some of these?
People believe what they want to believe.
I thought Tom would never leave.
I can't do this alone.
Tom was here before I was.
Tom didn't understand what Mary just said.
What are you looking for?
How did Tom get here?
Could you tell me what to put here?
She knows who you are.
I don't want to give up.
Let me see what I can do.
I don't have anything to do.
Can you buy one for me as well?
I'll call you if I need you.
Tom is good at what he does.
Ask her what her name is.
I wish there were more people like you.
Tom didn't need any help.
Why do you do it?
I thought you should see this.
I want to see them.
You don't have to come here every day.
Tell me where you live.
I heard you got a new car.
Tom doesn't have to stay here.
How did you get to know her?
Don't be late to school again.
I believe that he's happy.
We don't have a car.
I have to go now.
How old do you think I am?
All my friends call me Tom.
I do remember the day very well.
Why do you want to leave today?
Why do you have to go?
When did she get married?
You have no right to do this.
Why are you so busy today?
I just need one more day.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
Didn't you see the man?
Don't speak French to me.
You know what you have to do.
First, let's talk about what Tom did.
I still want to go.
Well, what happened to her?
Let me see what I can do.
She came to see me the other day.
Tom has a right to know.
Get out of my house.
Where can I find them?
He wants a new car.
He's the man of the house.
There is a better way.
I want you to have this.
Don't make me come back here.
I'm here to help you.
I did that today for the first time.
He can do it better than I can.
Tom had to go to Boston with Mary.
Tom got what he wanted.
Can I get back to work?
I had a good time yesterday.
Where did you go yesterday?
I will stay home tomorrow.
I know it very well.
I don't know who you are.
Would you like to go out and play?
Where did you get all that money from?
She came home very late.
You must not stay in bed.
We have to tell them something.
I'm going to be too busy.
Is that your dog over there?
I know a lot about you.
Tom was looking for something.
Where did you buy that book?
I know that you are busy.
Is that what you want?
Let's talk about the problem.
Please tell us what happened.
Why didn't she help you?
Did you want to speak with me?
I'll let you stay one night.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
Let's go and find Tom.
What did you talk about?
What time do you leave for school?
You did this to me.
Were you here last week?
Tom, I need your help.
Tom and Mary are good friends.
Tom and I were friends.
Tom doesn't know where Mary went.
I thought you wanted this job.
Don't leave me alone, please.
I bought a book yesterday.
I can't say anything about that.
We got into a car.
You can go if you want to.
What would make you happy?
Would you like to play with us?
I got you a little something.
I want to see Tom tomorrow.
Ask Tom to call me.
I have something for you.
Do you know what it is?
Where did you get it?
We're going to leave tomorrow morning.
Do you know where we live?
She came out of the room.
I can't believe I just said that!
Your name is Tom, right?
Tom got into the car.
He will be at home tomorrow.
Why do you work here?
They just wanted to be left alone.
All of us are happy.
I like this book better than that one.
Would you like to say something?
I can't tell what it is.
I think I love Tom.
I know what he did.
I'm not made of money.
This has never happened before.
I have a lot of friends in Boston.
You had better not go there again.
She could not find her way back.
How do I use this?
One can't live without water.
Tom will always be here for you.
Your name is Tom, right?
I don't know what's going on.
I thought you said you didn't speak French.
You should have seen it!
Take as much time as you want.
I remember what she said.
Who did you go with?
Let me think about it.
I want you to see her.
You should take a day off.
I need to talk to one of you.
Where does this book go?
I'm going to be there.
Do you know why she couldn't come?
What did you come here for?
I know that money isn't everything.
I've never heard Tom speak French.
Do Tom and Mary know?
That was all Tom said.
I don't want to eat here.
I'm doing this for him.
It's time to go to bed.
I'd do anything for you.
Tom will always be here for you.
I think he did it.
Tom wants a new car.
This is all that I know.
He can't buy a car.
You can stay as long as you like.
I don't need to tell you anything.
Do you have anything to eat?
I don't want to play with Tom.
What did you want to do?
Would you like a dog?
She told him that she was happy.
You are our only hope.
I can't let you do this.
May I see you tomorrow?
I said you could go.
I'm sure you knew that.
I don't like that name.
You should have come yesterday.
There is something about him I don't like.
Did Tom ask you out?
I'm too old for you.
Did Tom give you something?
It's about time for bed.
You know about that, don't you?
Do you want my help?
It's a long way from here to school.
May you all get what you wish for.
We just want to talk to Tom.
I won't be home for a week.
Do you know where we are?
I think I know where Tom is.
I wish I knew where he was!
I will go when they come back here.
There's always something to do here.
Get back in the car.
What do you like about her?
I think you should tell Tom that.
Where did they come from?
I need to know who you are.
Tom didn't know Mary would be there.
I know you don't remember me.
I don't want to live with you.
Have you seen Tom's room?
I won't be here tomorrow.
You know you need it.
You remember it better than I do.
This is just what I wanted.
Where did you put them?
Would you leave us alone, please?
Is that what he wants?
She got the money from him.
Do you feel better today?
I'm going to go now.
All this is new to me.
He was here at that time.
You should not stay up too late.
What do you think I was doing?
I think we should call Tom.
If I had money, I could buy it.
Tom couldn't understand anything that Mary said.
She was there all morning.
Tom can speak just a little French.
Tom can speak French and English.
She doesn't live with him.
Do you know his name?
He didn't come on time.
Find out what the problem is.
Can I help you with that?
He gave her a book.
I can't speak for Tom.
What is it that you want?
I'll give you as many as you like.
I need to find a job.
Is that what you want?
I thought about what you said.
I have to go to work now.
I'm not going to let you do that.
I don't understand French at all.
No one wanted to talk about it.
I had bought it the week before.
I really wanted to go.
It's just what I wanted.
She wanted me to come.
That isn't what I'm looking for.
What time will you leave?
Tell Tom I won't do that.
It is the car that we have wanted.
Tom will never tell you what really happened.
I think it's time for me to go.
I don't have time now.
I think I remember you.
Tom has never been married.
Let's go talk to Tom.
I didn't want to think about it.
We know Tom is here.
I had a long talk with Tom.
I know you're going to say no.
She asked for my help.
I can't speak French at all.
I know what you're going to say.
I love you more than her.
Like it or not, you must do it.
How old was she when she got married?
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want to remember.
I think this one is good.
That has nothing to do with him.
I have seen her before.
Let's hope he's all right.
I have to go get it.
My mother is out there.
He can only speak a little English.
Do the children go to school?
He doesn't know who I am.
Tom doesn't like his work.
You go on without me.
I want you to read this English letter.
I could never go back there again.
What does that have to do with anything?
I thought you wanted this back.
I'm looking for my brother.
I will do anything for you.
Do you have a book?
It's good to see you.
I've heard a lot about you.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
I'll see what I can do.
Never be late for school again.
I don't know any French.
I don't believe Tom can do that.
I want to make Tom happy.
Did you buy Tom a dog?
He asked me who that man was.
I heard what Tom said to you.
Why do you think Tom would do this?
This is for my friend.
She gave him the money.
What have you been doing all this time!
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
Would Tom help us if we asked?
I'll let you stay one night.
Do you want to stay?
You know I love you!
You don't need to work today.
I know how I feel.
Who would you like to speak with?
What are you up to?
There is no need for him to work.
I want to be alone!
Do as I tell you.
Was that you in the car?
Why don't you leave Tom?
When did Tom leave Boston?
Do you know much about Tom?
We'll help as many people as we can.
Tom asked Mary to come to Boston.
There's something we have to do.
I just want to go back to bed.
At first, I didn't like him.
I see how you did that.
We must work as long as we live.
I know what the problem is.
Do you really have no home?
Let's go to my house.
I couldn't remember his name.
You did a good job.
I wanted you to like me.
Tom does know what he's doing, doesn't he?
Why do they do it?
We have a little problem.
I didn't want to tell you.
I thought Tom was at school.
All of us speak French.
There must be something you can do.
I want you to take some time off.
I don't understand what he wants.
We won't go back to Boston.
Tomorrow is my day off.
I thought Tom would be happy.
Do you want me to do anything?
Why do I have to go to school?
You're going to be so happy here.
I thought it was Tom.
I do not want any money.
Just do what I tell you.
The way I see it, he is right.
We still can't see it.
Where did you live last year?
We all want to be happy.
You can't go in with this.
I don't want Tom to be alone.
You need to be there.
I often stay up all night.
Let me have a look.
Tom has never heard Mary speak French.
I know you're happy about that.
That's what I told Tom.
You said you didn't understand.
We'll eat on the way.
Where do you think Tom went?
I really want to do that.
He must be Tom's brother.
There's nothing more to say.
What do you want that for?
Why do you want me to leave?
No one can do it but you.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I had Tom make the call.
I had a little help from a friend.
Tom bought something for Mary.
Is that still my room?
I feel much better today.
How come you know English so well?
From now on, we'll do it this way.
The children went out to play.
I was going to use that.
I have to be there.
I will be here tomorrow.
Please do it this way.
I had a little help from a friend.
We just want our money back.
He got a new job.
That is what I want to know.
I've got no time for that now.
Tom is a friend from school.
Why don't you just call for help?
Tom isn't happy about what's happened.
She read the letter over and over again.
You like him, don't you?
I don't think I can do it.
He asked her if she knew him.
I know why you need it.
I need to get something to eat.
I'd like to be alone now.
I do not have any money.
May I call you tomorrow?
That's what I've always said.
May I call on you today?
Why are you looking at me?
We'll give you anything you want.
Please come to my house.
I don't see Tom's car.
I just heard from Tom.
Tom doesn't think that Mary will come.
Why can't I do it?
Tom wants to buy a house in Boston.
Why don't people like me?
Don't let them get away.
He had to stay in bed.
We still have to do that.
Tom wants to take a day off.
How much is a room?
All of us can speak French.
Tom never went to see Mary again.
Can I see that one?
Why should I help you?
I don't know what's happened.
He can speak just a little English.
You are not our friend.
Ask Tom to come tomorrow.
Didn't Tom want to talk to Mary?
You don't need to do that.
I want to talk with you about Tom.
Buy a book and read it.
I can do that if you let me.
They gave it to me.
No one knows what to say.
I don't have a lot of money.
Don't ask Tom. He doesn't know anything.
I still have work to do.
Don't call me so late at night.
I should do it now.
Can you do it in one day?
You know what you must do.
We see what we want to see.
That's what I look at.
Get out of the car.
Can you make it on time?
I don't need any more.
I told Tom what I know.
What do you have there?
Do you want to have children?
It's always been this way.
Tom thought about what Mary had told him.
I'll never go back to Boston.
Tom had a problem with his car.
Tom wants to ask Mary something.
Tom said he could give Mary some money.
They didn't know what to do with him.
Tom didn't speak French very well.
Is there a problem with him?
He has to speak English.
I thought you wanted to talk to me.
I think that's what Tom did.
Tom wants to do something.
What time did Tom get here?
Tom is not like that all the time.
What does Tom know about me?
Can you tell me more about Boston?
They bought a new car.
Tom asked me what I had been doing.
We won't need your help today.
Why didn't you want to go to Boston?
I told Tom to give me a call.
You don't know how much I love you.
Tom isn't as busy as you are.
I'll be back right away.
You should talk to Tom.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
That's what you said last year.
Don't believe everything you read.
I told Tom I didn't want his help.
I wish to see my father.
I'm sure that Tom will do that.
She can't live without him.
Have you ever been in love?
He doesn't have to go to school.
There's something about Tom that I don't like.
Tom doesn't need to go to work today.
I can't work like this.
I wanted to talk to you about Tom.
Who do you want to talk to?
Do you really want to know what happened?
My father told me where to go.
What do you want to do now?
Did you know him well?
Do you believe me now?
I don't want to see you here again.
She has no one to speak to.
I can't give up now.
I was not a good mother.
Don't tell me off like that.
Tom had a long talk with Mary.
Is the job too much for you?
Tom has just come back.
He may have said so.
Do you want to go again?
I don't know what we'll do.
We want you to help us.
I believe I can help you.
They really wanted to know what happened.
I have to help my mother.
I don't understand what's going on here.
Tom's new book is about Mary.
I asked him for his name.
Ask her to give us some money.
Tom and Mary don't want us here.
Tom is going to see Mary today.
I don't really know why.
He has no friend to play with.
I live just over there.
I want you to come with me.
Did Tom ask about me?
Tom wants to speak with you.
Remember to see him tomorrow.
Do you really want to do that?
His mother didn't want to do it.
She will be there by now.
I can't believe Tom would just give up.
You have to let me help.
May I ask how old you are?
Tom is a good man.
It doesn't look like Tom is very happy.
He took back everything he said.
What did Tom think Mary would say?
Tom is looking for work.
I couldn't do that to Tom.
I hope you like me.
I'm too busy to go.
I need to see him again.
Can you tell me what happened to Tom?
I don't really know Tom.
What did you do with Tom?
Tom will always love you.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I want to see it.
What can I do for you?
By the way, I saw him yesterday.
Tom, there's something I want to give you.
I know my father will help me.
Who told you to give that to me?
This is for you, Tom.
Why is he doing this?
That isn't going to help you.
Ask her what she bought.
I think he is a good man.
He asked for some money.
It's just like you say.
Doesn't that make you happy?
You have to do it.
I can tell you what I know.
I didn't want to know.
He was about to speak.
Where did you buy it?
I thought so at first.
Never be this late again.
I really wish I could help.
Does Tom want to see me?
If you want me to go, I'll go.
Did you go to Boston?
Why didn't you tell her?
Have you seen my new car?
How long have you been doing this job?
I did everything I could.
I need to know something.
It is time to go to school.
I had no friends in Boston.
You won't be the first.
Where did you buy it?
You should get to school.
I thought I'd never see Tom again.
So what do you want with me?
I asked for his help.
I have bought a car.
I don't know what more I can say.
Have you used it yet?
Is Tom looking at me?
I don't have time to read.
I think I like it.
I can't understand what happened.
Why are you so sure?
I asked him to help me.
I'll take you to Tom.
I want to be a good father.
I'm happy doing what I do.
When will you come home?
I speak English every day.
I believe I'm in the right.
I don't have any friends.
Do you like this book?
What happened to you yesterday?
Every dog has his day.
Tom knows just how you feel.
I can't do it without you.
We'll go after we eat.
I'd like you to read this book.
You must do as you are told.
Tom asked Mary why she was late.
I'll tell you all I know about it.
You have to leave Boston.
This is how I made it.
Don't you want to stay here with us?
He asked his friends for help.
I heard that Tom is going to Boston.
I speak French every day.
Do you need to leave today?
I had a good time, too.
He was right after all.
Don't you like any of these?
I know what I'll do.
I gave one to Tom, too.
How do you go to school every day?
I like you a lot.
That's a very good car.
Tom knows what you did.
I would like to know her name.
I don't want to go alone.
She got married to him.
Is there something you want to tell us?
Tom wanted to see me right away.
I went out with my friend.
Do you want me to go now?
People like you are never happy.
Did you ever speak to Tom about it?
I have not heard from her yet.
Why do you want to work here?
I have everything I've ever wanted.
I really like this book.
They did a good job.
I don't want to buy it.
Where did you buy that book?
I want to go out with her.
Tom has something to say to you.
Let's give Tom some room.
Tom wants to know what's going on.
Where can I find him?
It's always been like that.
I had to go to Boston.
Did you get your wish?
When did you go home?
Tom wanted Mary to be happy.
Get back in the car.
I know what really happened to Tom.
Do you know if she can speak English?
Tom won't do that with me.
Tom asked me to speak to you.
One is new, and the other is old.
What did you buy it for?
I know nothing about him.
There is no other way.
I like her very much.
What's Tom going to say about that?
What does Tom need this for?
I did this for you.
Did you live here before?
We need money to do anything.
That man didn't give me his name.
I can eat it in here.
Do you have something for me?
I don't want to go alone.
I don't know why we came here.
Tom doesn't speak French at home.
I am going to go right away.
I only want to help.
He read a really long book today.
Tom came after Mary left.
What can I do to help you?
From here, I can't see it.
If he has time, he will come.
I have a lot to do today.
Do I have to go now?
Tom didn't look happy at all.
Tell me where you live.
I just want to go to bed.
What do you want me to do?
I was in bed all day long yesterday.
I don't have any children.
What do you think I've been doing?
Tom won't be happy to see you.
I know how old Tom is.
I want to talk to you.
I'll tell you what I did today.
I thought I heard you.
Tell her that I am busy.
And what happened after that?
This car is as good as new.
Can I get back to work?
What time did you get here this morning?
Don't be late for school.
I'm not going to tell you my name.
She didn't have a brother.
The more one has, the more one wants.
He has bought a new car.
I'll give you my car.
Tom has to do this.
Tom wants us to talk.
I really don't have much time.
I know what love is.
She married him for his money.
When did you see her last?
I've got the day off today.
It is what it is.
Why do you love me?
Tell me what you think about my car.
We made him go there.
I'd do anything for you.
I've seen Tom at work.
I wish she had come last night.
Tom didn't want anything to do with Mary.
It's not why I'm here.
How may I help you?
I'm sure you're very busy.
I asked Tom to help.
Tom wanted to see Mary happy.
Let's not talk to her.
He wanted to buy the book.
How often have you been there?
So, where do you want to do this?
I won't work with him.
She gave him a lot of money.
Tom wants to get married.
I'm not sure I want to see this.
We want to speak with Tom.
Where have you been all night?
Why do I have to talk to Tom?
Your friends are in there.
I live in an old house.
Do you know where we live?
I did that at school.
I was in Boston yesterday.
Let's see what you're made of.
Where did you buy that book?
It is too late for him.
It's good to see you.
Tom knows who they are.
Do you really think that Tom won't come?
Tell me where you live.
I want to do my job.
Let me talk to Tom alone.
How many of you are there?
I am happy to see you again.
I don't need your help.
I'd love to talk to you.
She had a little money.
I just need more time.
But do you like it?
I go to school with Tom.
Why did Tom leave you?
I never knew his first name.
I don't know why they don't understand.
Why don't you take the day off?
Do you know how to use this?
I don't know what Tom is looking for.
I'm just going to stay home.
What do you want me to do?
I can't speak French as well as Tom.
I don't want any more.
Father is out, but Mother is at home.
I didn't want you to know.
What took Tom so long?
I'm the man of the house.
I don't have many friends.
How old do I look?
Tom knows what we did.
I think I'm going to stay here.
I need to find Tom now.
I can't make out what he wants.
There's something I should tell you.
You may take anything you like.
I'll never leave you alone again.
Tom told Mary not to go.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
I'm as old as you.
It won't take me a long time.
I want to be there, you know.
Where are you going now?
I know what Tom was doing.
Tom told me what happened.
What is he up to?
I have a lot to do today.
Do you know when he will come?
I don't like what he said.
Please buy me this book.
I want you to come home.
Work is everything to me.
I'll put you up for the night.
You should eat something before you go.
I want to talk to you about something.
You won't have that problem.
I have no friend to talk with.
He wants a book to read.
Why don't you go and have a look?
Tom wanted to see Mary again.
I want to eat it.
I've come here to help you.
I had to get some money.
Do you remember what she said?
We're going home by car.
Tom wants to be more like Mary.
We may be late for school.
I'm too busy to talk to you now.
It is a little late for that now.
Did Tom ask you anything about that?
I didn't ask for it.
Tom knows something isn't right.
What was Tom's last name?
What are you going to say?
I know why Tom's happy.
Do you want my help?
You have to do it.
I don't know where I'm going.
I'll leave this work to you.
I need a new one.
They are out of work now.
Do you really want to live in Boston?
He doesn't have to know.
He wants you to come home.
I don't know what that is.
What do you want to talk about?
When will he be busy?
You should get married in Boston.
Do I need to go there?
It's a car that I bought.
I don't have time for this.
Where does he come from?
Tom doesn't really like you much.
That isn't much, is it?
Why are we doing this?
He can't come with us.
I think Tom wants our help.
Tom bought a new car.
Tom isn't going to like it.
I know nothing but this.
I've got something for you, too.
Tom and Mary were friends.
Look at what Mary is doing.
Won't you come with me?
You must not look down on old people.
Tom and Mary want to talk to you.
I know how to do it.
Tom didn't go to school.
I thought that he would come.
Do you think I'm happy?
Don't stay out too late.
I wish I had been there with you.
How many do you need?
This used car is as good as new.
Can I do something to help you?
She wanted to help them.
Tom is a good friend.
We're here to help you.
Does Tom know what you're doing?
We want to go home.
I'll get back to you.
Did Tom help his mother yesterday?
I'd like to know what you think.
Your French is very good.
I would do anything to get a job.
I'm really happy you could come.
Don't believe anything they say.
What did you want to ask me?
Why did she ask for our help?
I did that the day before yesterday.
What's your last name, Tom?
I'll never see her again.
What can you give me?
Go to your room now!
We're a little busy here.
I saw nothing at all.
I want to work here.
I thought Tom had a dog.
He does not have any friends.
I'll never leave you alone again.
Are you happy or not?
We just have to do it.
Get that book for me.
How did you see that?
We're happy to be here.
Tom said he knew you.
Hope to see you again next year.
Where did you see Tom?
How many people work here?
She is never on time.
Tom doesn't have to work today.
It couldn't have come at a better time.
Can I help you with something?
Where were you that night?
I want to buy that.
I just don't know what to say.
I don't have much time.
I can only tell you what I know.
When did Tom get here?
Tom didn't want to go.
How old is your father?
I thought you wanted this.
She gave the dog to her friends.
He gave away all his money.
Tom knows who Mary is.
Why won't Tom let you use his car?
I'm sure I'll find a way.
How did Tom get it?
I wish I could do something.
Are you going to stay long?
I need to get something for Tom.
I've only just come back.
Did you understand what he said?
We will be at home today.
You have to do it.
That was all Tom said.
It was her first job.
I think about it every day.
Have you been told when to come?
I told Tom that he couldn't speak French.
I asked Tom to stay.
How many people do you know well?
If I have time, I'll do it.
You came at just the right time.
I don't want to go to school.
I just can't get used to this.
Your dog is over there.
I went up to the door.
I can't say anything about that.
I never knew about Tom.
Who do you want to speak to?
She asked about my school.
Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
I don't remember what I have to do.
This is something I have to do.
Tom has no friends to play with.
He is just right for the job.
We only want to help you.
Tom doesn't know where to look.
We never saw Tom again.
Only time will tell if he was right.
Has Tom ever been married?
He will get better little by little.
I'm not as happy now.
Tom would like to buy a house.
Are you sure that you know me?
I love you like a brother.
You like me, don't you?
Is Tom really happy here?
Do your children speak French?
I don't have all day.
I had to stay in bed all day.
I didn't want to give Tom any money.
Boston is where I want to go.
Why would you want me to stay?
Why are you doing this?
I don't know who she is.
May I speak to you alone?
Tom never used to do that.
Where did you find Tom?
Tom told Mary that she was right.
No one knows Tom is here.
I thought Tom and Mary were married.
I need to know what happened last night.
Tom doesn't have a job.
I don't have much time now.
I don't want to talk about love.
Did you make any new friends?
I want to speak with you.
Why do you love me?
I don't have a car.
What do you wish you knew more about?
Tom wants to think it over.
I got up late this morning.
What am I doing here?
When did you get here?
This is my first time.
I'd like to make a call.
Don't put that away yet.
Do you have the book?
Will you go with Tom?
I know all of them.
We must never do this again.
I want you to stay where you are.
Does he know how you feel?
I still don't believe it!
Do you really want to do this?
When did you get there?
This is how I feel.
What does she look like?
He was here at that time.
Tom knows where we are.
Why don't you talk to Tom?
I say it all the time.
Do you want to leave today?
Will you give this to Tom?
I do that a lot.
There's a call for you.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
I have to get away from here.
I need a new one.
If you can come tomorrow, please do.
I wanted to go home.
Tom can't leave us now.
Who do you want to talk to?
All my friends call me Tom.
I thought you were going out with Tom.
I can come at three.
I'd like some time alone, please.
I have something to ask Tom.
It's time for me to go.
Where can we get what we want?
There's got to be something you can do.
Tom never saw her again.
I don't remember what I have to do.
Can we just go home?
I want you to stay right here.
You don't have to stay.
You can leave the room now.
What time did you get up today?
Tell me what you want.
I'll say it one more time.
He came to see you yesterday.
Is that all you have?
No one can help you.
I don't know when Tom will come.
Tom didn't want to see me.
She made him do it.
What did you say your name was?
Tom asked me to help.
Is that too much to ask for?
"Will he come?" "No, I don't think so."
How will you get back?
Come here. I need to tell you something.
What was it that Mary bought yesterday?
I thought you were a friend.
You can go there if you want to.
I need to know how to do this.
Tom wanted to go to Boston.
I had a good time, too.
I'm going to the well to get water.
Is there anything for me?
I want to know what happened.
Do you want to talk about it?
I thought you wanted to get married.
How long have we been married?
Tom is not a happy man.
Let's do this first of all.
I have read this book before.
He is one of my old friends.
I don't know where it came from.
I do my job well.
All I have is a book.
Are you looking for a job?
You're going to get better.
How can you be so sure?
I just don't like it.
I only have one brother.
It's time for you to go to bed.
By the way, where do you live?
What book did you buy?
I want to know who told you that.
Why are you busy today?
Tom is the man of the house.
I said you could go.
I want to go with you.
Why did you use up all the money?
I'll buy you a new one.
Let me know what I can do.
We don't have that long.
Let's not do this again.
Tom really made me feel at home.
Is there anything we can do?
Tom will be busy tomorrow morning.
You had better not see her today.
When did Tom live in Boston?
I will speak to you tomorrow.
I'm going to call Tom right now.
He came to my house.
We use a lot of water every day.
I don't know where to put them.
I won't let you leave.
How long do you think we were away?
I'll have to think about it.
My friends don't know where I am.
Tom won't talk to Mary.
I know you can make it.
I want Tom to help us.
Tom wants to know why.
I want to look like Tom.
Can you give me some money?
Why do you all look so happy?
I thought it was love at first.
Please take Tom with you.
Why did Tom say that?
I remember what it was.
She did not go there.
I'm not sure what I should do.
You won't have that problem.
Tom doesn't want to talk to you.
You let me down, Tom.
Who did you talk to?
Tom asked Mary to go away.
He came into the room.
This is what I need.
I have just come back from school.
Tell them to call me before they leave.
Can you please leave me alone?
The other one doesn't work.
When will you go to school?
I hope he's all right.
I just need to do something.
Let's see if we can help you.
I need to know more.
I can get you everything you need.
She has not come here yet.
I want to be in your life again.
I want to live here.
Did you understand what he said?
I'm busy all the time.
I don't ever want to see you again.
We have always been friends.
Tom is in his room now.
Can I have it back now?
Now it's up to me.
I'm going to eat it.
How long are you here for?
Get me out of here.
I don't know what's going on.
We couldn't do anything for them.
Are you busy right now?
I didn't know you were there.
Why didn't you let me know?
If he doesn't come, we won't go.
This is a good house.
You had better go to bed now.
You don't need to do that right away.
Do you know what you need to do?
Tom used to be married to Mary.
I can get anything I want.
What time did Tom leave?
What did he ask you?
Would you like to know who that is?
Won't you speak to Tom about it?
How many children do you have?
What are you going to see?
When did you come back from Boston?
I wish I could see Tom again.
Tom said he was in love with Mary.
I'll never let you down.
I use it every day.
I had never seen her.
I'd like to see you tomorrow.
How many do you need?
They were all friends as children.
I know how busy Tom is.
I wish you could have come with me.
I know what I heard.
He is still on his back.
You can be anything you want.
I think he can't do that.
I can still help you.
I did it for Tom.
I can't remember how to go there.
I want to know how you did it.
I want you to have something.
I was on my way to school.
Are you still in love?
This may be of use to you.
He made a will last year.
Can I do something for you?
You can take today off.
Here is a letter for you.
This is the one I want.
I don't know where I am.
Did the car look old?
I told you Tom would help us out.
I really have to go.
I thought you knew that.
I knew I had to come.
I want to know who gave you that.
Tom wanted it this way.
We can't help you now.
I'll find Tom and let him know.
I know how we can help.
You can be sure of that.
I didn't need to do that right away.
They want to do this right.
It is up to you.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants.
Why do I have to talk to Tom?
What would she have said?
I'll do everything I can.
I knew Tom was married.
I was happy to help you.
How much money do you want?
He doesn't want to go to school today.
We're very happy for you.
I have to go to work.
They were all friends as children.
You should have told me that before.
I don't want to see you again.
No one came to help me.
I don't know why they do it.
I don't know who I am.
Tom should be at home.
I'd do anything for you.
Do you want to see my room?
She must be very happy.
People believe what they see.
What would you do without me?
I just wanted you to know that.
I knew you were going to ask that.
I know what you want.
I don't want to go with you.
I have just what you need.
I gave up my job.
Tom knows that Mary went to Boston.
I need you to stay with me.
Tell me what that man is like.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom didn't know what to say.
I'll never leave you alone again.
There is little time left.
Were you at home yesterday?
Help me and I will help you.
Children often ask me for money.
Have you been told when to come?
You should not go alone.
Can you help me get out of here?
Tom doesn't feel up to going out today.
Can I tell you something?
I'm going to eat it.
Is there anything I should know?
It is something my mother made.
We must do more than yesterday.
I think that you're right.
He came home late last night.
I don't want to go back in there.
I do not know what I will do.
I think you could be happy here.
You know we didn't do this.
What do we have to do?
He was going to school.
Tomorrow is the last day of school!
I want more of that.
Tom is with his friends.
I want you to leave right now.
Why won't you talk to me, Tom?
I didn't know Tom very well.
I knew this day would come.
I can't remember ever doing that.
We all know what happened here.
What do you want to know?
Can you give me that?
I used to go to school with him.
We don't have to talk about this now.
It's been a good day.
Tom doesn't like my dog.
I just need time to think.
Please tell me about your problem.
You never give up, do you?
Would you do something for me?
Are you sure you want to be here?
I thought you didn't know that.
Could you do that for me?
I'll get there before you will.
May I call you tomorrow?
He is a good man for the job.
He went out of the room.
I wanted to ask you something.
I don't know anything about anything.
That book is a new book.
I knew you could do it.
He told me that you were right.
What should I tell Tom?
I saw him come this way.
Are you going out tomorrow?
Tom won't tell us anything.
What do you think of that?
How come you didn't tell Tom about me?
I didn't tell him everything.
I just want to talk.
Let me look at you.
I have a lot to do today.
I want to go with you.
There is something I don't understand.
I don't want to talk about it.
This is for my friend.
Have you ever read a book in French?
He's not as old as my brother.
He didn't tell me everything.
She didn't give me her name.
What did Tom talk about?
He did what they told him.
Why don't you come to Boston?
Tom is looking for a job.
I know what they want me to do.
I hope you are all well.
I didn't want you to go away.
Tom should go to bed now.
I think we should do that again.
I thought I knew everything.
What would you like to eat?
I could never do it like you do.
I didn't know what had happened.
Tom asked Mary for help.
Tom had a very good time.
No one man could do it.
I just want to go back.
I've got no time for that.
Do you still really want to go?
If you want, you can go.
I was going to use that.
What time do you go to work?
You get used to it.
Why do you want to leave today?
This is a very old book.
She went out of the room.
Tom is a very good friend.
She gave him a book.
Tom knows a lot of people.
Tom couldn't say what he wanted to say.
It's time to go home.
This is always the way it has been.
A man came to see him.
Why doesn't he come back?
Why do I have to talk to Tom?
Do you want to stay with me?
That's something I couldn't do.
Isn't this what you want?
Why are you looking at me that way?
I think my French isn't very good.
I know what Tom did.
Get out of my bed.
Get it away from me.
I left something in the room.
They had no money left.
What time do you leave?
Get out of my bed.
They don't want you. They want Tom.
You remember that, don't you?
Tom wants his money today.
You don't speak English, do you?
Please don't do that again.
What do you want to buy?
What is the good of doing it?
Let us never speak of this again.
Tom came home very late.
We need to have a talk, Tom.
What do you think she said?
Would you like to go?
Tom doesn't know who Mary is.
Is that where it happened?
I need to get one.
I don't know how it happened.
I think it's very good.
Tom thought he would be late.
Who can I talk to?
He is busy with his work.
You can't see what I can see.
Is there any room for me?
What do you think they want?
Do you think I should tell Tom?
I can't give up now.
Do what you believe is right.
Tom knows it's too late.
Can you help me get out of here?
I'm just looking out for you.
Do you know what he said?
I still don't believe it.
He was right the first time.
I know just what to do.
Tom doesn't want to go to school.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
I'm not sure there's a problem.
I just want to read.
I know what it is.
She did not read the book.
I don't like it at all.
Tell me where you live.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Have you been told about the problem?
How does it feel to be back?
You don't need to go.
Did you want to see me?
I like English very much.
Did you call me last night?
I'm not used to it.
We can do it right now.
I'm still looking for Tom.
I wish he were here.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had.
Tom and Mary don't know that.
Do you think I'm made of money?
If I want something, I get it.
Can't we work this out?
You didn't tell him anything?
Tom and Mary are just friends.
At first, I didn't know what to do.
It was the only way to go.
Where do you really want to go?
Tom wanted me to tell you something.
When will he be back?
She left here right away.
Why didn't you get married?
Tom has to get back to work.
Should I buy something for him?
Are you looking for something?
I feel much better now.
Have you read this book yet?
I can't believe we're here.
There is a time for everything.
I'm not going to have to do that.
Please don't go in there.
I thought Tom would want this one.
I have to go home.
Are you looking for work?
You must be a friend of Tom's.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
I know what you're going to say.
I knew Tom would be here.
I can't tell you why Tom is late.
I don't want to see you.
It was not always this way.
Where did you go with Tom?
I told Tom I'm from Boston.
See you next week, Tom.
You must read this book.
I've thought about you a lot.
Do you believe what he said?
Tom didn't know what he was doing.
Do you think I still love her?
Is Tom one of them?
I didn't want to think about it.
Can you take me to Tom?
I know that you love Tom.
Was Tom at home yesterday?
Can you tell him from his brother?
He can only speak a little English.
You made me do it.
Tom didn't know what to do.
Do you know any French?
I have a problem here.
Did you go out last night?
This book is very new.
I don't know what to do first.
Tom made it on time.
Do you know how to use this?
I hope we can be good friends.
Where do you live now?
What do you want, Tom?
Why are you still in Boston?
I have to go get it.
You remember Tom, don't you?
Can I buy that from you?
Can you help me get out of here?
Please tell me how to get to Boston.
Do you have the time?
Just tell me what you want.
I don't know if you remember me.
How did you know we were here?
Tom is not going to do it.
I can't believe I'm here.
I don't have any money with me.
I thought you would understand.
Can you tell me why you like him?
Don't you want to know?
I thought you said Tom was your brother.
We're going to see him right now.
She doesn't take after her mother at all.
I thought you would understand.
There's a lot of room in here.
I asked Tom to stay.
I have more work to do.
You never say you love me.
This is what I have to do.
I don't see Tom's car.
I am better than you.
Tell me why you came back.
Are you happy right now?
Who told you to buy that for me?
I should go with you.
He didn't want to think about it.
I don't know when I'll be back.
I really must be going.
I'll help you as much as I can.
Where do you want to go?
Now, go have a good time.
Tom can speak French well.
Where did it come from?
Tom doesn't want to see you ever again.
My friends don't know where I am.
I don't think you should call Tom.
He can't buy a car.
I know it for sure.
How did you get this money?
Would you like some more?
I know how old you are.
I have something that you should see.
Give it back to me!
They made me come here.
Tom wants to see you.
Tom can go if he wants to.
I know where you live.
I must tell you something.
I can't go to work today.
Go back to your bed.
We see him every day.
How did you know we were here?
I thought that you wanted to see me.
You must not do it now.
Didn't I tell you so?
I've got something for you.
Do you know what love is?
What was Tom doing here?
Where do you think you're going?
Why don't we go home?
I hope you're not alone.
So what do you want to know?
You can't go where I'm going.
Could you look at me, Tom?
Tom is the right man for Mary.
I'll see if Tom's here.
What time did you come home?
We wish you well, Tom.
I'm here to help you.
I am happy to see you here.
Do you know what happened?
You can eat all you want.
Please tell me where to go.
You should make good use of your time.
We just need more time.
Tom doesn't understand what you want.
Don't ask me. Ask Tom.
What are you going to see?
Tom can speak French better than I can.
How often do you see him?
I believe you like your job.
I'll buy you a new one.
Do you think Tom will like it?
I have been busy all this week.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
I want you to stay.
Tell me you love me.
Tom and I are very good friends.
Do you know where I can find Tom?
I don't know who you want to see.
Does Tom live in Boston?
I thought you didn't want to go.
You don't know what you're doing.
When did you get up this morning?
How much money do you want?
Can I see this one?
She is about to leave.
You know what I need.
Tom doesn't have much time.
That won't be a problem.
I wish I could help you.
Only time will tell if he was right.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
He was home alone at the time.
Why don't you get something to eat?
I'll give you anything but this.
Why is it that you are always late?
There is no need for him to work.
Let's not ever do that again.
You're not very happy, are you?
What about the other one?
I want to say something to you.
What did you want to tell me?
What were you doing when I saw you?
We're a little busy right now.
I know I can do it.
What do you want to buy for her?
What does Tom want to know?
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
It's time to do something.
I thought Tom was one of them.
Will you stay at home?
I told Tom you were busy.
What are they made of?
You may go home now.
He is looking for a job.
How can I get back at him?
Tom wants to do a good job.
Do you think Tom saw Mary?
I thought you were happy.
We must go to school.
I have to go back to work.
I was happy to see him.
I think they saw me.
I want to go with you.
I will stay at home.
I had never seen her before that time.
I thought you could help me.
What is this all about?
She doesn't want him to go to Boston.
I need to go to work.
Give me some time to think.
I only think of you.
Do you know how busy I've been?
There's still a long way to go.
Put it where you like.
We'll give you anything you want.
I need to talk with you.
Get out of my room!
I'd like to think so.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
I'll take it to Tom.
I asked Tom to help Mary.
You have to go back.
I'm in love with her.
She got out of the car.
Do you really think it's no good?
You are his brother, right?
Can you please leave me alone?
You don't need to do that.
I don't remember what I have to do.
Do you know where it is?
What time do you want me to come?
Who came up with something like that?
Do you love him too?
My father is always busy.
I don't want to leave Boston.
I told you to stay put.
You don't need to do that right away.
I can do it now.
I'm looking for Tom. Have you seen him?
I know who that is now.
You just made my day.
Who do you think you are?
I'll do the work tomorrow.
You need to help me.
Tom didn't look happy to see me.
I'd like for you to leave.
Were you home last night?
Do you still love Tom?
Tom was never really in love with Mary.
I don't know what Tom will say.
I should go back to work now.
Tom said he didn't know.
They gave us a lot to eat.
How do you think I feel?
Why do I have to talk to Tom?
I'm still married to Tom.
By the way, where do you live?
I know a man who can help.
You can't go in there alone.
Tom doesn't know I'm here.
Tom and I got married.
I don't know what Tom thought.
You can't know that for sure.
Who will look after your dog?
I just don't want to go with you.
I didn't think he would come.
I'd like to see you again next week.
What do you want to talk about?
I didn't know who you were.
It's good to see you.
Please let me speak first.
Tom still doesn't really like Mary much.
I had to do something.
I need to ask you something.
I have no time left.
I don't want this one.
Tom didn't believe what Mary said.
We didn't know what to do next.
What do you want me to do?
This was his one and only hope.
You are to do as I tell you.
Let's leave it at that for now.
Can she come in time?
I've got nothing to say to him.
I hope Tom is right.
I'll stay in the house today.
I need some time to think.
This was too much for Tom.
I don't know what I want.
I'll tell you what happened.
What does Tom think of Mary?
I just want to go to bed.
I want to see it again.
What more can you say?
I know him only by name.
He asked for the money.
He won't come, will he?
What time do you want me to come?
Why are you doing this to me?
I knew they were your friends.
I have just read this book.
I want you to leave my house.
What do you want now?
Why do you love me so much?
I'm busy, so I can't go.
Tom has nothing better to do right now.
No one knows what's really going on.
I think that they will be late.
I can't remember what her name is.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
Tom doesn't know what time it is.
I'll take this to Tom.
I've never made a lot of money.
I should talk to Tom.
He's good at what he does.
I remember what you said.
What book did you buy?
Tom used to live in Boston.
Do you want something to eat?
I used to live there.
I bought it for you.
I wish I had a car.
Don't make me ask you again.
What do you want with me?
I want to talk to you.
I had a busy morning.
He doesn't know any of us.
I can't believe I'm here.
Is there anything I can do to help?
I need to know why you need this.
I don't understand why you want it.
I need to let Tom know.
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You know where everything is.
Why couldn't you come yesterday?
Tom wanted to find out.
What does Tom want us to do?
What do you want to buy?
I didn't put this here.
I thought you said you didn't see anything.
Would you like some help?
How do you feel about it?
I know your father very well.
My father has bought a new car.
How long will they stay?
Don't you ever give up?
What time do you go to bed?
Do you like to be alone?
Do you know any of Tom's friends?
Did you find anything in the room?
I know who you are.
I am happy to see you again.
What do you need to do today?
Do you think Tom will like it?
I thought Tom would talk about that.
I don't remember it at all.
I went to Boston with Tom.
Do you need the book?
Is that all you bought?
No one knows what happened.
You like English, don't you?
Did you come here alone?
I want him to go there.
Why do you put up with that?
Did you call me last night?
How old was Tom at that time?
He did it for money.
That's what we want to know.
Do you want to play?
She has a lot of money.
Tom didn't want to work in Boston.
What did Tom tell Mary not to do?
She asked for your help.
No one will believe me.
Come and see me tomorrow.
Let me tell you something about Boston.
I've seen all I want to see.
He can speak only a little English.
I had to let Tom go.
I want to talk about Tom.
Where were you last night?
I have no problem with that.
You can't be so sure.
What did you want to talk about?
I know it was Tom.
Tom asked for some money.
You didn't tell me everything.
He came after you left.
I would ask him if I were you.
We don't live in Boston.
Don't come home too late.
Tom is married, isn't he?
Take a look at this.
Tom wants me to stay away from you.
I can do it again.
He is sure to come.
I just don't want you to have it.
I know where you live.
What were you doing at that time?
Tom is good at French.
I can't do that now.
Can you tell me what this is?
I think we made the right call.
I don't know why it didn't work.
Can you come with us?
I want to know how you know that.
I'm used to it by now.
Did she come with him?
Why would you want Tom to do that?
I'm not going to your house.
Tom didn't believe what Mary told him.
I will ask him tomorrow.
I'll get them for you.
Tom and Mary did what they were told.
Tom told the dog to stay.
Are you a friend of Tom's?
I can't remember what his name is.
You must be very busy now.
My little brother asked for some money.
Give me something to eat.
I asked him what his name was.
I will read a book.
We never talk about it.
Are you looking at me?
You don't have to help me.
Tom left everything to me.
I have bought a car.
But I can't understand them very well.
Tom asked Mary to give him some money.
Do you know who said that?
I'm too busy to help him.
Do you know who I am?
Look, I know what I saw.
I am like my father.
May I go out to play?
Will you stay at home?
Tom said that he had been busy.
All of my friends can speak French.
Can I see you again?
I want to know what you're doing here.
Are you going to school tomorrow?
Let me know what you want to do.
It's too late for you.
I can't tell you what happened.
I need to see it now.
Tom used to speak French better than Mary.
Why did Tom come back?
Can you help me, please?
Say what you want to say.
I was made to go there.
I should have said something.
I'm happy to see you here.
This book is really old.
I bought this book the other day.
What are you here for?
I wanted Tom to take me with him.
Why do you believe Tom?
I have to ask Tom something.
I got a letter from a friend.
I don't think she can speak French.
Why did you come home so late?
You have what they want.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Do you really want to be here?
He got all he wanted.
My little brother can read English.
I don't think that he will come.
Let me see if I can do anything.
I want you to stay here with her.
You don't have to do that.
It's about time to go to school.
How do you know my father?
I know what you did.
My father bought a new car.
May I have one of these?
I know what you want.
There's got to be a way.
I can't believe I'm doing this again.
Would you like to play with us?
Why didn't you think of that before?
What does your father do?
Do you know what time they came?
She wanted to be alone.
No one said anything about that.
She asked me how old I was.
We must do more than yesterday.
I'd like you to call me Tom.
Will he ever come back?
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to eat.
I thought you didn't have any money.
Is there a problem here?
I really need your help.
I don't understand why you want it.
We still have more time.
Do you want to do that today?
Do you have anything to read?
Tom had to go there alone.
I don't think I'll go today.
I thought it must be something like that.
What time do you have?
We wanted to do it right away.
Tom can speak only a little French.
What more could I want?
That's not our problem now.
Tom will know where to go.
I can't tell you anything.
I need Tom to see this.
Don't you tell me what to say.
I feel like going out today.
You know where to find me.
I don't want to let Tom down.
Tom and Mary are still there.
If you ask him, he will help you.
He came to ask us to help him.
Don't be late for school.
I don't have time right now.
Tom never wants to see Mary again.
We did what we were told.
Is there anything you need to tell me?
I told him to come.
I go to work by car every day.
Don't you know his name?
You never say that you love me.
Where do you come from?
I'm the only one who knows them.
That's all I want to know.
Tom wanted to see me.
Tom doesn't have any children.
Does Tom know what you're doing?
Do you know what she said?
Where do you come from?
Why didn't you get married?
I used to be like Tom.
I wish I could do that.
I don't know if I can do it.
Do you want to know how I feel?
Please do not buy it.
I'm going to Boston next week.
It's time to go home.
He is always with me.
Did you talk for a long time?
I'll talk with you when you're not busy.
We don't need your money.
Tom wanted to stay home with Mary.
I asked Tom if he knew Mary.
Would you play with me?
Tom will need our help.
Tom didn't ask Mary anything.
Please give me the letter.
Tom wants to buy a new car.
She is in need of help.
He wants me to go with him.
I have three friends who can speak French.
I was home all day yesterday.
I've still got work to do.
I'm going to read the book.
Do you want the job or not?
He's the one who told me about that.
I hope it's better tomorrow.
Tom wanted to buy it.
As long as there's life, there is hope.
Do you have anything to do today?
Can I have it back now?
You don't know who I am.
Who will you be going to Boston with?
You all look so happy.
I don't want to give up.
She married him for his money.
It's time for us to go.
This is all I can do.
I have to go to bed.
We have made friends with Tom.
He is like a father to me.
I want you to have this.
Tom wants to know if you remember him.
This job is too much for me.
Do you think Tom knows?
You want me to go, don't you?
I was late for school this morning.
Tell me again that you love me.
I'm here for you, Tom.
Can I see this one?
I want to know who did that.
I just wanted to see if you knew.
I like this house as it is.
Does Tom know about this?
There is a better way.
I'm going to take a look.
I need help with this.
We still have a lot of time.
There's no one but me here.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
She was looking at me.
I know Tom doesn't want to be there.
I'll stay here and help Tom.
You won't be the first.
Please give me one of these.
How come you didn't call me last night?
Did Tom ask you out?
I saw him just now.
Why are you always late?
I have to tell you something.
Do you want to see more?
Tom said he doesn't do that.
Tom and I were busy.
You can use my car.
I don't know anything yet.
My English is anything but good.
Tom was looking for Mary.
He doesn't come here every day.
Give it back to him.
Without money, he could do nothing.
I didn't want to tell you.
I can't see anything from here.
Tom still has some time.
I'm not sure I want to see this.
Were you out last night?
I can't do without her help.
Tom doesn't like Mary very much.
I was about to leave my house.
There's something I should tell you.
I believe I can help you.
Why are you all here?
Nothing can be better than that.
I don't like it at all.
How do we do that?
I know what Tom would say.
I don't want to be seen with him.
I don't want you to tell Tom.
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
At first, I thought he was your brother.
I love him more than anything.
We gave them everything we had.
We know where Tom is.
What are we going to do next?
Tom said you wanted to see me.
I got married and had children.
Why didn't Tom tell Mary?
Where there is life, there is hope.
Tell me who you saw.
Can I do something to help you?
I don't understand any of this.
Tom is still your friend, isn't he?
I'm very busy this week.
Why did you do that?
Tom doesn't think you understand me.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
Why am I doing this?
Tom and Mary don't want children.
I couldn't understand anything that he said.
You have to help me.
What would you like to do today?
That's why I came to talk to you.
We used to be friends.
How long will you be away?
I can't do any more.
Tom didn't want to go home.
Why doesn't Tom like Boston?
It's a lot of work.
How can you be so sure?
I can't tell you what Tom told me.
I went to school with Tom.
Who are you looking for?
What do you want me to say?
Do you want to help?
Last night, I saw something.
Tom didn't know what this is.
Can I see that one?
I don't know what to do next.
Why do I feel this way?
No one said anything to me.
I think they know you.
I can't do it now.
Tom really knows a lot.
How did Tom do that?
Tom didn't say anything about that to me.
What are you and Tom doing tomorrow?
She left with her friends.
Why didn't you just ask me for help?
Don't talk to your mother that way.
I think we can make it on time.
He is not down yet.
He did not know where to go.
Why am I still here?
I need you to find Tom.
May I use your car today?
What do you think about the book?
Can I go with Tom?
Tom wants to say something.
When was the last time you saw her?
I see what you're doing.
Tom bought this for me.
When did I give you that?
He's at home right now.
Why doesn't Tom want to go?
I'm looking for that right now.
Do as I tell you.
What school did you go to?
I need to talk to you.
I love what I'm doing.
Please just leave me alone.
I think I'm in love.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
You can't give up now.
This is good, isn't it?
Tom knows Mary very well.
I think that you're right.
What do you hope to find here?
Tom didn't know that Mary could speak French.
There's nothing I want from you.
No one will believe him.
Mother is very busy just now.
I know we can do it.
You have to leave Boston.
I will tell you if you wish.
How often do you see him?
I want to talk to her.
All of them speak French.
Do you know why I'm here?
I didn't know Tom could read.
You don't need to go.
I know where Tom is.
May I speak to you?
My mother said that she was all right.
Tom and Mary will go with me.
He said he didn't like this.
You're going to like it.
You need to talk to Tom.
I would do it if I could.
Tom did what I wanted him to do.
Have you ever had a job?
Where do you think Tom is?
Do you have time tomorrow?
Call me if you find it.
I didn't ask you to come.
She is everything to him.
I leave in the morning.
I wanted Tom to stay.
She did a good job.
Tom didn't want to work with Mary.
You were right after all.
How do we do that?
How did Tom know that?
I have some money with me.
I want to see you.
Were you at home last night?
Now we don't know what to do.
You will see that I am right.
What happened to you two?
Tom told Mary not to go there alone.
I've been looking for you.
That isn't what I'm looking for.
I think you should do it.
I believe that's what you said.
What do you want me to call you?
I don't want to eat this.
Tom isn't married to Mary.
We'll see Tom next week.
Today is our last day of school.
By the way, where are you from?
Tom has been busy all morning.
Tom doesn't want to talk to me.
There's nothing to do here.
Tom will never believe that.
I thought Tom was in Boston.
What are we going to do next?
What do you need to know?
I'll give you everything you need.
Why do you love me?
What was it that you gave him?
Where can I see you?
I really can't do that.
You must do as you are told.
Does Tom know what to do with this?
I thought Tom would say that.
I'm too busy to help him.
I don't want to go to work today.
Tom knows who they are.
Tell Tom that I'm here.
Tell Tom I love him.
Why should I buy something I'll never use?
Tom is married to Mary, isn't he?
Let me tell you something.
I know you can make it better.
I'm going to go talk to Tom.
I thought you were off today.
That's not what I'm here for.
I thought I knew him, but I didn't.
You have to believe us.
It's always been that way.
I want to eat something.
She isn't at home now.
I thought it would be here by now.
She can't have said so.
You have to help your mother.
Tom didn't eat anything yesterday.
My brother has no money.
You know what I like.
I wish she had come last night.
When do you want to do this?
I speak French and English.
You're the love of my life.
Tom wanted to say something to Mary.
I do not know anything about him.
What do you want to tell us?
I eat there every night.
Did you want to see me?
We can't give up now.
I'll see you a week from today.
After that, I didn't see him again.
Did he go to see Mary?
I know something you don't know.
We don't have the money.
Will you go with us?
I'll tell you what the problem is.
Would you like to eat with us?
You can come if you want to.
Why did you want to buy them?
We have a lot of time.
I made you something to eat.
Go to your room now!
Tom did his job very well.
Tom and Mary want to see us.
Tom has never had much money.
They can't give me what I want.
I don't have anything to give you.
I'm going to give you something.
Don't play in this room.
I don't want to go there again.
I know Tom is happy.
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Who wants to go next?
I had to give Tom a little money.
How much money is left?
I'd like to stay here with Tom.
You talk as if you knew everything.
They know who she is.
I'd like to speak with you alone.
Tom doesn't know how it happened.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
I never said that to Tom.
Tom knows Mary isn't very happy here.
Let me tell you what I did today.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.
What does he want to do?
Is that what you want, Tom?
I want to say something to you.
Who do you want to talk to?
Who do you think he is?
When did you want to go?
I don't know what's in there.
She must be ill in bed.
Don't stay up late every night.
I told Tom I was there.
You had better do what they say.
Tell Tom I love him.
How did you get into my house?
Where do you speak French?
I don't think she would understand it.
I was with Tom last night.
Do you want to talk?
Tom can speak French very well.
Can I go in there now?
Take the money with you.
I thought Tom would understand.
I don't want to go to bed yet.
I'd like Tom to take me home.
Give me time to think it over.
Are you sure you want that one?
I don't want to go to bed.
Are you sure you want to be alone?
How much of this does Tom know?
What's going on in here?
I don't know what to do now.
You don't have to come here every day.
Who did this to you?
I know that he knows.
I believe I can help you.
He must be very happy.
I saw what you did.
He left everything to her in his will.
Why do some people not want children?
Give me time to think it over.
I had never seen him before.
That didn't help very much.
Do you have many friends?
We just want to talk.
Have you ever been happy?
She was about to go out.
When will you get home?
I want you to leave us alone.
You have to come with me.
We can all do this.
I don't know him at all.
What can I say about him?
Do I need to go right now?
I can tell you what I know.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
Tom didn't want to do that.
Can I have some of these?
I can't believe he's Tom.
I'm sure he will come tomorrow.
You must be in love.
It can't be that he is busy.
Tom doesn't speak to Mary.
Take Tom out of here.
He's the one, isn't he?
Why don't you let us go?
I don't know what love is.
What do you really think of him?
What was he doing when you saw him?
You can tell me anything.
Tom thought I knew Mary.
I know what it's about.
Tell me where you live.
Do you know who they are?
Where did Tom buy it?
I need to go back.
I'd love to live in Boston.
Tom knew Mary was right.
I think that you're right.
Please tell me what happened to him.
I never want to talk to Tom again.
Are you back home now?
Are you sure you want to do this?
You don't know everything I do.
You may use my car.
I know you speak French.
I'd like to know more about Boston.
What is it you want from me?
I'm not the only one who did that.
So you give up, right?
I do all the work.
You're never going to believe this.
No one will ever find you.
We use a lot of water.
Tom made Mary tell him everything.
How does he know that?
I don't see Tom often.
One of us should talk to Tom.
Do I have to do it over again?
Tom didn't know what Mary would like.
Can't you do anything to help Tom?
Do you want me to leave?
They know who I am.
Get out of the water.
I can't go back with them.
He asked me for help.
You may stay here with me.
She doesn't like going to school.
I don't know who did this.
I said, "Is there anything I can do?"
This is only for you.
Are you going to buy the car?
I don't know if he knows it.
I am looking for my brother.
I don't remember what I need to do.
Last night I was at home.
I have to help Tom.
Don't you want to know why?
What did you give me?
I never heard anything like that.
Why did you do this?
I'll be here when you get back.
Can you please look the other way?
I can't remember his name.
I go there every year.
I want to go home.
I've never seen anything like this before.
I want you to get in the car.
Tom just didn't want to see me.
May I come and see you tomorrow?
Tom didn't want to do anything.
I want you where I can see you.
Where do they do that?
Where did you eat last night?
That's not something I know how to do.
What did you do that for?
He often doesn't come to school.
I can't tell you that.
Let's get back to work.
Tom and Mary are very old friends.
I can't do any more than this.
I had a very good time today.
Don't tell Tom I'm here.
I hope that I can do it.
Have you ever seen one?
Tom told me that he doesn't want that.
I don't want to be away from home.
Tom wanted to get married to Mary.
Find out where Tom is.
I couldn't make him understand my English.
Do you want me to help you?
I go home right after work.
I have to stay in bed all day.
She read the book all night.
Tom knows what Mary said.
We can still get there on time.
Tom is the one who doesn't understand.
Do you really want me to do this?
Tom isn't always late, but he often is.
You should have seen it.
What would you like him to do?
You don't like Tom very much, do you?
Have them come in right now.
They don't talk about it.
I want you to come back with me.
That's what I told him.
She asked him if he was happy.
I have a good job.
I have to talk to you about Tom.
Tom just doesn't know what to do.
This is the house I live in.
I know who they are.
Why did you come to see me today?
If you stay, I'll stay.
Tom and Mary were in love.
Tom should be in school.
How did Tom do it?
I can't understand what you said at all.
I go where I'm told to go.
Tom wants to talk to all of us.
I thought Tom would like to see this.
He went to see her the other day.
I hope that she will help me.
It doesn't work very well.
He took a week off.
Tom used up all his money.
What do you call this?
I don't want to help you.
We have to get away from here.
She asked me for help.
Stay out of my way.
What are you doing today?
You know how Tom is.
I told you that before.
I know everything about you.
I know who he is.
We're so happy for you.
I have to leave now.
You have to let go.
Tom asked me about my job.
I don't know what has happened to him.
There is a man at the door.
Tom and Mary want to see you.
I didn't know what it was.
I want to talk to him about it.
Have you ever been in love?
I don't have the money.
Get out of my house.
Let's say no more about it.
I wish I had more friends.
Let's get in the car.
Do you have many friends?
I don't like your friends.
I don't remember your name.
May I have your name, please?
I want something to read.
There's a problem there that you don't see.
I am out of work.
You can do it, can't you?
Tom doesn't have to go to school tomorrow.
They are the people who live next door.
Tom was like a father to Mary.
Why didn't Tom call for help?
This isn't what I asked for.
He wanted to come with us.
I can help you if you let me.
I am in the house.
I didn't know this was going on.
Who do you think will come first?
How did he find us?
I was in bed all day long yesterday.
No one gave up hope.
Tom and I are friends.
How does he go to school?
She came to see me.
You can do what you want.
One of us will have to go.
I like my new job.
Did you just get to know him?
You may come in now.
Tom doesn't understand what's going on.
What does that have to do with Tom?
How long will you stay?
That car is very new.
It happened just like this.
This has nothing to do with me.
Who is in this room?
I've got a lot to say.
That's just what I wanted.
Tom didn't come to school yesterday.
I have a lot of money.
I've never seen one of these before.
We thought that you were married.
It's time to go to bed.
I don't want any help.
Let Tom know where I am.
You should stay at home today.
I'm not going to eat this.
I asked Tom to come.
It's time you got married.
I don't want to eat here.
If you want to stay, you can stay.
Your father won't buy it.
Tom wanted to see you.
I know a man you work with.
Where did she go yesterday?
This isn't my first time to be here.
You're not one of us.
When will we go home?
At first I didn't like it.
Can't you do something to help me?
Tom gave up all hope.
I don't want to do this with you.
He let me leave the room.
I should go with you.
Would you like to see my new car?
You like English, don't you?
Why are you doing this?
I have to leave now.
I don't know if I should tell him.
What are you going to do with it?
I like the way you talk.
I was the last one out.
Were you told to do so?
I want to talk to Tom first.
Tell me where he is.
You had better go to bed now.
I have but one wish.
Please tell me where you bought that.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
Tom is like a father to me.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you remember his name?
I'm sure it will get better.
He's going to love this.
Tom said he never wanted to get married.
I thought Tom had heard us.
I need to talk to Tom alone.
That's why I came to talk to you.
You should find a job.
I need to know his name.
Tell me what your name is.
We don't have a dog.
We have a little water.
I just want you to go away.
Tom didn't do much work today.
I have a little money now.
Tom does what he wants.
Do you want me to go with you?
Do you know who he is?
I was there with Tom.
I wanted Tom to see me first.
I can't believe you married Tom.
Do you really think it's no good?
There were many children in the room.
It was a good day.
He read the book yesterday.
I never heard from him again.
Tom wants to eat with us.
What happened to the dog?
You have no right to do that.
Tom doesn't have to stay here.
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
Do you see him often?
I wanted to talk to you first.
I didn't know Tom had a brother.
I thought you said you were alone.
How much should they get?
Do you still love me?
I'm not here to help you.
I want to go there.
Who gave Tom all that money?
What did you talk about?
I would like to come to see you.
It's not going very well for you.
Do you come here often?
Put it where children can't get at it.
I don't see the problem.
I'm here as a friend.
Did you tell them anything?
Do we have to talk about this?
What happened the other night?
I know that she has been busy.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
Why do you always do that to me?
Do you want me to do anything?
What more can I do?
I want to know why Tom isn't here.
Did you get there on time?
I will look the other way.
I think we do a really good job.
You're not the one we're after.
How do you call your dog?
Are you doing what you think is right?
Did Tom find what he was looking for?
He came to ask us for our help.
He still wants to come.
Are all of them your friends?
What will I tell Tom?
You knew I was married.
He told me his name was Tom.
I had to stay home.
It's better than doing nothing.
Tom is your friend, isn't he?
I think we need more water.
What would you like to eat today?
Why didn't you stay with Tom?
Let me tell you everything I know.
I'm not as busy as Tom.
Where can I find Tom?
She may not come here tomorrow.
I know something Tom doesn't know.
You must stay with me.
What are we here for?
I know what I said.
This does not make me happy.
We're not going to Boston.
Any bed is better than no bed.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Now what do we do?
Do you like to be alone?
Did you call him up yesterday?
I didn't know where to look.
If only he had been there.
I wish I could speak French.
I know about the job.
Tom can't tell time yet.
Do you come here every day?
I was busy all day.
I thought Tom had left with Mary.
Do you know Tom well?
I wish Tom were here.
I don't see that as a problem.
We need something to eat.
What did you say your name was?
Do you know how to do this?
What happened to her this morning?
Do I have to do it over again?
Tom won't be at home tomorrow.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
I really like that car.
Tom really had a good time.
He may not be happy.
Tom will help us, won't he?
I'll do what I can to help you.
I need to go home.
Tom doesn't want to go with you.
Why don't you go play with Tom?
Who will you give the book to?
We want Tom to stay and help.
I wish I were there right now.
How do you feel about what she said?
Tom is better off without you.
I don't want Tom to find Mary.
It doesn't take very long.
I don't want to work for you.
I don't remember you at all.
That's why I came here.
I wanted Tom to come.
You must not be late for school.
I didn't come here for Tom.
I'll give it to you.
The letter is for me.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
I don't remember what I need to do.
Do you want to get out of here?
What car did he take?
I know what to do.
Like it or not, you must do it.
What happened to my door?
Tom is the only friend Mary has.
Tom is still in bed.
They won't find you here.
How did you find that out?
Tom and Mary have been married for years.
I like her a lot.
Can't we go with Tom?
Do you have to do that now?
I will make you happy.
I want a lot more.
It's you who doesn't understand.
Tom doesn't have any friends in Boston.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
How much is too much?
What do you hope to find here?
"Does she have a dog?" "No, she doesn't."
Is it time to eat?
The children don't have school today.
What do you want me to tell Tom?
I didn't feel like going.
You can do anything you want to.
I got a call from her this morning.
Do you want to stay here?
I didn't see him again after that.
Can I go in there now?
Tom is in love with me.
I didn't ask for you.
What were you doing about this time yesterday?
I can't work any more.
I've got something for Tom.
Do you really want to help Tom?
I see you remember me.
Is it time you need?
We only want to help you, Tom.
I can get you more.
You need money to make money.
She asked me where I was going.
I'm not sure that I can help you.
I'm just doing my job.
Will you come or not?
I always knew you could do it.
Do you know what I did?
Tom had a good day at school.
There's something we need to talk about.
I wish I didn't have to work.
I wanted to see you.
He was made to do so.
He did what he had been told.
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
I speak French very well.
Tom, get us out of here!
I think I need help.
Tom and I are just friends.
I do not like the house.
I can't take it any more.
I just want to find out what happened.
He will be here today.
There's something I've got to say.
It's better you don't know.
I want to talk to Tom.
Do you know where she went?
I have got to go now.
Won't you speak to Tom about it?
I have been looking for you.
I have little money now.
Tom had nothing to eat yesterday.
Come over and help out.
That's what Tom wanted you to think.
Tom doesn't know Mary is here.
We can't go right now.
I can do it without your help.
You must help your mother.
I don't want to ask you anything.
Tom! What are you doing?
Tom knows what you did.
We're going to see him right now.
That's the way I like it.
No one is to leave.
I'm not here to make friends.
I know what it's about.
That's all we know for sure.
I have something for Tom.
Could you read this for me?
Did you buy this book?
I know what to look out for.
He knows that you know.
I don't think about you.
We know you're busy people.
I didn't know it was Tom.
Don't make me say it again.
What do you want to do?
That house is really better than this house.
Is that what happened here?
Where did you buy them?
Do you still want to go to Boston?
I've come back for you.
You're going to be seen.
Why did you buy a car like this?
I couldn't find his house.
What does your car look like?
I will look after the dog.
How do you do that?
I'll tell you what Tom told me.
Can you make it on time?
Do I have to do this now?
You won't find what you're looking for here.
They know who he is.
You should have come yesterday.
I must tell you something.
I will have him come.
He went to school by car.
I want to get out of here.
Tom asked her if she was Mary.
He's often late for work.
Do you know where I live?
You won't find anything here.
I don't think you really want to know.
I can't tell you yet.
Do you really want to know what happened?
Not everything can be bought with money.
Give me a little more time.
We have no school tomorrow.
Tom is doing very well today.
He has not come home yet, has he?
This car is as good as new.
I'm very happy to be here.
Tom wanted to say more.
Is Tom in on this?
We think that he will come.
I didn't know Tom did that.
He's not the right man for you.
Tom and Mary are very much in love.
The three of us get on very well.
I have just come back from school.
Put the book back where it was.
Do you do this every day?
Tom asked Mary to come again.
